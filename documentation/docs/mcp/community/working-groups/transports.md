# Transports Charter

> Charter for the MCP Transports Working Group.

## Group Type

**Working Group**

## Mission Statement

The Transports Working Group evolves MCP transport bindings and transport-adjacent
protocol architecture so implementations remain interoperable, scalable, reliable,
and easy to operate across local and remote deployments. The WG produces transport
proposals, SEPs, implementation evidence, and guidance. The
[working group repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg) and
its [upstream charter](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg/blob/main/CHARTER.md)
maintain the WG's current technical focus, proposal strategy, and supporting detail
within these boundaries.

## Scope

### In Scope

* **Transport Bindings**: Framing, delivery, request and envelope metadata,
  cancellation and termination, connection lifecycle, backward compatibility, and
  the behavior of existing and future MCP transports. The current specification's
  [transport overview](/specification/draft/basic/transports) defines the boundary
  between a transport binding and core protocol semantics.
* **Scalability and Reliability**: Transport-level connection management, resource
  efficiency, multiplexing, load distribution, error handling, reconnection,
  resumption, and the delivery and ordering guarantees offered by a binding.
* **Transport-Adjacent Protocol Architecture**: Protocol-wide message-flow concerns
  required for scalable, interoperable bindings, including request association,
  per-request metadata, stateless operation, and migration from legacy initialization
  and transport-session models.
* **Transport Security**: Binding and envelope security requirements such as Origin
  validation, TLS, mTLS, and certificate handling, coordinated with the Security IG.
  Credential carriage is coordinated with the Auth IG.
* **Validation and Guidance**: Reference implementations, experiments, implementation
  evidence, and documentation needed to evaluate proposals and help implementers
  adopt agreed transport behavior. Supporting material is maintained in the upstream
  [documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg/tree/main/docs).
  The WG contributes transport scenarios and requirements to the Conformance Testing
  project, whose maintainers own the conformance suite.
* **Cross-Cutting Coordination**: Transport implications of work owned by other MCP
  groups, without taking ownership of their application-layer features.

The upstream [scope statement](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg/blob/main/CHARTER.md#scope)
provides supporting context but cannot expand the boundaries in this charter.

### Out of Scope

* Application-layer behavior for MCP primitives such as tools, resources, prompts,
  tasks, agents, or events, including application state, application-session meaning,
  task lifecycle, and event or subscription semantics. The WG coordinates where those
  features depend on binding or message-flow behavior.
* Domain-specific extensions and implementation-specific product or business concerns.
* SDK APIs and implementation details unrelated to transports.
* Authorization protocol mechanics, credential and token semantics, application
  identity, and authorization policy. The WG coordinates with the relevant groups on
  how bindings carry agreed authorization data.
* Ownership of the MCP conformance suite. The WG contributes transport requirements
  and scenarios in coordination with its maintainers.

### Related Groups

* **[SDK WG](/community/working-groups/sdk)**: Official SDKs implement transport
  changes; the groups coordinate on feasibility, reference implementations, and
  rollout sequencing.
* **[Agents WG](/community/working-groups/agents)**: The Agents WG owns Tasks and
  durable execution; the groups coordinate where these depend on multi-round-trip
  requests, request association, stateless operation, or binding behavior.
* **[Triggers and Events WG](/community/working-groups/triggers-events)**: Event
  callbacks, subscriptions, and application-level delivery semantics are owned by that
  group; Transports owns binding-specific carriage and guarantees.
* **[Auth IG](/community/interest-groups/auth)** and
  **[Security IG](/community/interest-groups/security)**: The groups coordinate on
  credential carriage and transport wire security while authorization mechanics and
  broader security requirements remain with the respective IGs.

## Leadership

The current WG Lead is
[Kurtis Van Gent](https://github.com/kurtisvg).

## Membership

Current WG Members are listed in the upstream
[group membership roster](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#members).

## Operations

The WG holds a regular weekly meeting, with the current time and joining details listed
at [meet.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://meet.modelcontextprotocol.io). Topics are
discussed asynchronously in `#transports-wg` on the
[MCP Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX).

Work follows a problem-first workflow:

1. Create a core problem statement in the
   [working group repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg) to
   align the WG on the problem and its requirements.
2. Work with other interested participants to define a solution.
3. Review and iterate on the solution to address WG feedback.
4. After the WG reaches consensus under its decision-making process, present the
   solution to Core Maintainers as an SEP through the
   [SEP process](/community/sep-guidelines).

## Deliverables & Success Metrics

### Active Work Items

See [open pull requests](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg/pulls)
and the [`roadmaps/` directory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/transports-wg/tree/main/roadmaps).

### Success Criteria

* Adopted transport-agnostic protocol behavior remains consistent across transports,
  while binding-specific differences are explicit and validated by implementation
  evidence and applicable conformance scenarios.
* Transport changes that affect official SDKs are coordinated with the SDK WG and have
  clear implementation guidance.
* Decisions, proposal status, and supporting rationale remain publicly discoverable in
  or linked from the working group repository.
