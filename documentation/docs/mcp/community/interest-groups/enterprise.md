# Enterprise Interest Group Charter

> Charter for the MCP Enterprise Interest Group.

## Group Type

**Interest Group**

## Mission Statement

The Enterprise IG identifies and documents the requirements gaps that enterprises encounter when deploying MCP in production. As MCP adoption scales across regulated industries and large organizations, enterprise teams face recurring gaps in areas such as authentication integration, identity propagation, audit and compliance, gateway behavior, scalability and resilience, and configuration management that are not yet addressed at the protocol level. The group brings together enterprise practitioners to capture these gaps as problem statements and structured recommendations, and to channel them to the relevant Working Groups for specification work. Governance and best-practice patterns may emerge from these discussions, but the group’s core mandate is surfacing protocol-level requirements, not maintaining a general best-practices catalog.

All discussions and sessions are protocol-focused and vendor-neutral. The Enterprise IG is not a venue for product pitches or vendor-specific marketing. Participants contribute as practitioners sharing deployment experience and requirements, not as representatives promoting commercial solutions.

## Scope

### In Scope

* **Enterprise Requirements Gaps (overarching focus)**: The group’s primary mandate is identifying enterprise deployment requirements that are not addressed at the MCP protocol level today and turning them into problem statements and recommendations for the relevant Working Groups. Each requirement is captured with the enterprise opportunity it represents, not only the pain point, since closing these gaps is what unlocks broader enterprise adoption and value. The specific domains below are explored through that lens; governance and best-practice patterns are documented only where they surface a protocol-level gap:
* **Enterprise Authentication and Identity**: Discussion of enterprise-managed auth patterns including IdP integration (SSO, SAML, OIDC), token lifecycle management, On-Behalf-Of (OBO) token exchange flows, and fine-grained authorization (Rich Authorization Requests). Gathering requirements to inform the Auth WG and related SEPs.
* **Identity Propagation and Session Context**: Defines how verified identity is surfaced and conveyed across MCP clients, servers, and downstream services for policy enforcement and audit. This includes spawned-agent and delegated-agent use cases: identity lineage, least-privilege for child agents, descendant revocation, and auditability across multi-agent chains, which is adjacent to authentication but distinct in focus.
* **Audit, Observability, and Compliance**: Exploration of standardized audit trail formats for MCP tool invocations, integration with enterprise SIEM and observability platforms, and evidence generation for compliance frameworks (SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, EU AI Act). Includes sector-specific compliance patterns such as PHI handling and BAA-scoped data flows in healthcare environments.
* **Gateway and Proxy Behavior**: Documentation of enterprise deployment patterns where MCP traffic routes through API gateways, load balancers, reverse proxies, and security proxies. With the move to a stateless protocol core in the 2026-07-28 release, the focus shifts from session affinity to gaps that persist in a stateless model: header and context propagation, authorization handoff across proxies, and policy enforcement at the gateway.
* **Scalability and Resilience**: Running MCP at enterprise scale across regions and availability zones. With the stateless core enabling horizontal scaling without sticky sessions, the focus is on failover, load distribution, and reliability for mission-critical deployments.
* **MCP in Enterprise Architecture**: Definition of how MCP fits into broader enterprise architecture, including integration with existing middleware, data platforms, and agent orchestration layers.
* **Configuration Portability and Deployment**: Discussion of challenges in deploying MCP servers across heterogeneous client environments, multi-tenant configuration patterns, and enterprise-scale rollout practices.
* **Interceptors and Middleware**: Exploration of use cases for request/response interception in MCP pipelines, including PII redaction, compliance validation, content filtering, and hallucination detection. Gathering requirements that may inform future specification work on middleware patterns.
* **Problem Statements and Use Cases**: Documentation of enterprise pain points and production failure scenarios (anonymized) to build an evidence base for prioritizing specification work.
* **Recommendations to Working Groups**: Providing structured input from enterprise practitioners to the Auth WG, Security IG, Gateways IG, and other groups on enterprise-specific requirements.

### Out of Scope

* Writing or owning SEPs. The Enterprise IG produces problem statements, use cases, and recommendations. Concrete specification changes are driven through the appropriate Working Groups.
* Discussion of product-specific or vendor-specific solutions. Discussions must remain vendor-neutral and focused on protocol-level patterns.
* General MCP support or onboarding. The group focuses on enterprise deployment challenges, not introductory MCP topics.
* Overlapping directly with the Auth WG's specification work. The Enterprise IG gathers enterprise auth requirements and feeds them to the Auth WG rather than proposing auth protocol changes.

### Related Groups

#### Working Groups

* **Auth WG** — Enterprise auth requirements (IdP integration, OBO flows, RAR) are gathered and provided as input to the Auth WG's specification work.
* **Transport WG** — Transport-level needs for enterprise support (non-functional requirements such as latency and horizontal scaling) are bundled and provided as input to the Transport WG.
* **Extensions WG** — Requirements for extensions other than authorization are bundled and provided as input to the Extensions WG.

#### Interest Groups

* **Security IG** — Overlapping interest in runtime security, tool poisoning, and credential management. The Enterprise IG focuses on the organizational and governance dimensions; the Security IG focuses on threat models and protocol-level mitigations.
* **Gateways IG** — Direct overlap on gateway/proxy behavior patterns. The Enterprise IG provides enterprise deployment context; the Gateways IG focuses on technical gateway specifications.
* **Financial Services IG** — Several enterprise concerns (compliance, audit, regulated environments) overlap with the FS-IG. Cross-posting and joint sessions will be coordinated where appropriate.

### Decision Process for Recommendations

The Enterprise IG produces non-binding use cases, problem statements, and functional and non-functional requirements. To ensure clarity and avoid downstream process debates, the following applies:

* **Problem statements and use cases** are contributed asynchronously via GitHub Discussions or Discord threads and reviewed during monthly meetings.
* **Recommendations to Working Groups** are finalized through lazy consensus among participants, with a 7-day review period posted on GitHub. If no objections are raised, the recommendation is considered approved.
* **Facilitators** are responsible for packaging approved recommendations and delivering them to the relevant Working Group or Interest Group.

## Deliverables (Optional)

As an Interest Group, the Enterprise IG does not produce binding deliverables. The following are planned discussion outputs:

| Item                                            | Status  | Target Date | Champion      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Enterprise Pain Points Catalog                  | Planned | Q2 2026     | Raghu Chandra |
| Healthcare & Compliance Use Cases (PHI, BAA)    | Planned | Q3 2026     | Aman s        |
| Enterprise Auth Requirements (input to Auth WG) | Planned | Q3 2026     | TBD           |
| Gateway Deployment Patterns Document            | Planned | Q3 2026     | TBD           |
