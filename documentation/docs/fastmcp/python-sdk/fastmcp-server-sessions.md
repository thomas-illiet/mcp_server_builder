# sessions

# `fastmcp.server.sessions`

Stateless session state: server-side per-user and per-session storage.

Modern (2026-07-28) MCP connections are stateless by construction — every
request builds a fresh connection whose in-memory state is discarded when the
request returns. This module gives tools two explicit ways to keep state across
calls, both backed by the server's existing state store and both isolated by the
authenticated principal rather than by any client-declared identifier.

* `Session`: async `get`/`set`/`delete`/`clear` over a single dict stored under
  one key, scoped to a `(principal, session_id)` pair. This is the state-accessor
  object a handler works with — the value the standalone `get_session(id)`
  returns and the value injected for a `UserSession` parameter.
* `session: UserSession` (injected): a per-user bucket, dependency-injected like
  `ctx: Context` and keyed by the request's authenticated principal. Requires
  auth. `UserSession` is the injection annotation; the injected value is a
  `Session`. It is always available under auth — no `create_session`, no
  provider, no validation.
* `session_id: SessionId` (argument): a required string the agent supplies,
  resolved with the standalone `await get_session(session_id)`. The id is
  minted
  by `create_session`; an id that was never created (or was created under a
  different principal) is rejected. This validation is the whole guarantee — an
  unminted id never resolves, so nothing enforces provider registration.
* `SessionProvider`: a `Provider` contributing `create_session` / `end_session`
  tools. Register it with `mcp.add_provider(SessionProvider())` so a tool that
  takes `session_id` has a way to mint ids; without it, no id can be created, so
  those tools simply cannot resolve a session.

Isolation is the authenticated principal, not the session id. State keyed by
`(principal, session_id)` means a request under principal B can never address
principal A's keys, no matter what `session_id` it passes; the id only organizes
sessions within a principal. Without auth there is no principal wall — a session
id is a bearer capability and sessions are not a boundary between clients.

## Functions

### `current_principal` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L139" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
current_principal() -> str | None
```

The authenticated principal for the current request as a compact JSON string.

Returns the `(client_id, issuer, subject)` triple encoded as compact JSON, or
`None` on an unauthenticated request. Two users of one OAuth client are
distinct principals whenever the token verifier supplies a subject.

### `session_storage_key` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L164" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
session_storage_key(principal: str | None, session_id: str) -> str
```

The single storage key holding a session's state dict.

Keyed by `(principal, session_id)`: the principal is the isolation wall, the
id organizes sessions within it. A session's whole state lives under this one
key as a dict, so one key means one store TTL per session and `end` is a
single delete.

### `session_id_parameter_names` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L343" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
session_id_parameter_names(fn: Callable[..., object]) -> tuple[str, ...]
```

Names of a function's parameters annotated with `SessionId`.

Scans resolved type hints for `Annotated[str, _SessionIdMarker()]` metadata.
Returns an empty tuple when the hints cannot be resolved (the function then
simply carries no auto-populated session-id description).

`functools.partial` is unwrapped first, since `get_type_hints` rejects a
partial object — FastMCP supports registering a partial as a tool, and its
schema is still built from the underlying function, so its `SessionId`
parameters must be detected here too. Parameters the partial has already
bound — positionally or by keyword — are dropped, matching the tool's actual
argument surface (the partial's own signature already reflects this).

### `CurrentSession` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L449" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
CurrentSession() -> Session
```

Inject the per-user `Session` for the current authenticated principal.

Rarely written explicitly — a `session: UserSession` parameter is rewritten
to this. Provided for parity with `CurrentContext()` when an explicit default
is preferred.

### `OptionalCurrentSession` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L459" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
OptionalCurrentSession() -> Session | None
```

Inject the per-user `Session`, or `None` when the request is unauthenticated.

Rarely written explicitly — a `session: UserSession | None = None` parameter
is rewritten to this. Provided for parity with `OptionalCurrentContext()`.

### `create_session` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L468" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
create_session() -> str
```

Create a new session and return its identifier.

Mints an unguessable `uuid4`, records an initial session owned by the current
principal, and returns the id as a string. Store it and pass it back as a
`session_id` argument on later calls to persist state across a session — only
an id created this way resolves. State is keyed by the authenticated
principal, so the id organizes sessions within a user; on an unauthenticated
connection the id is the only thing standing between callers, which is why it
is unguessable.

### `end_session` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L490" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
end_session(session_id: SessionId) -> str
```

End a session and delete all of its state.

Validates the id like any other resolution (an unknown or foreign id is
rejected), then deletes the session's key so the id no longer resolves.

## Classes

### `SessionAuthError` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L106" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

An injected `session: UserSession` was requested with no authenticated principal.

Per-user session injection keys off the request's authenticated principal, so
it is only meaningful under auth. A tool that needs cross-call state without
auth should take a `session_id: SessionId` argument instead.

### `InvalidSession` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L125" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

A session id did not resolve to a session created under the current principal.

Raised by `get_session(session_id)` when the id was never created, or was
created under a different principal. The public message is deliberately
generic — the specific reason (which id, which principal) is logged at debug
level, not returned to the caller, so an attacker cannot distinguish "unknown
id" from "belongs to someone else".

### `Session` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L175" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Async accessors over one `(principal, session_id)` bucket of state.

A session's state is a single dict stored under one key. That dict holds user
state in a `state` sub-dict and a small creation marker alongside it, so a
created-but-empty session is still distinguishable from a missing one.
`get`/`set`/`delete` read-modify-write the sub-dict; `clear` empties the
sub-dict but keeps the session valid; `end` deletes the whole key. Writes
never impose a TTL — retention is entirely the server store's (configure it on
the store you pass to `FastMCP(session_state_store=...)`).

Concurrent writes to one session race on the read-modify-write; session state
is small and typically driven serially by one agent, so this is acceptable.

**Methods:**

#### `id` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L205" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
id(self) -> str | None
```

The session's identifier, or `None` for an injected per-user session.

For a session resolved from a `session_id` argument (or minted by
`create_session`) this is that id. An injected `UserSession` has no
distinct id — its bucket is the authenticated user — so it is `None`; the
internal principal-derived key is deliberately not exposed here.

#### `get` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L254" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
get(self, key: str, default: Any = None) -> Any
```

Return the value for `key`, or `default` when it is not set.

#### `set` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L259" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
set(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None
```

Store `value` under `key` in this session (read-modify-write).

Preserves the creation marker: only the user-state sub-dict is touched.

#### `delete` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L270" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
delete(self, key: str) -> None
```

Remove `key` from this session, if present (preserves the marker).

#### `clear` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L281" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
clear(self) -> None
```

Empty the session's user state but keep the session valid.

The user-state sub-dict is reset to empty while the creation marker stays
in place, so a cleared session still resolves through `get_session`.
To invalidate a session entirely, use `end` (what `end_session` calls).

#### `end` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L294" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
end(self) -> None
```

Invalidate the session — delete its one key and all of its state.

After this the id no longer resolves through `get_session`. This is
what `end_session` calls; `clear` only empties state and keeps the session.

### `UserSession` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L303" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Annotation marker for the injected per-user session.

A `session: UserSession` parameter is **dependency-injected** like
`ctx: Context`: keyed by the request's authenticated principal, excluded from
the input schema, and requiring auth (it raises `SessionAuthError` with no
principal). It doubles as the injection *annotation* and the injected
type — the value a handler receives is a `UserSession`, which subclasses
`Session`, so `await session.get(...)`, `.set`, `.delete`, and `.clear` all
work exactly as on any other `Session`.

Unlike `session_id: SessionId`, the per-user bucket needs no `create_session`,
no `SessionProvider`, and no validation — it is always available under auth,
keyed directly by the caller's identity.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.sessions import UserSession

@mcp.tool
async def remember(fact: str, session: UserSession) -> str:
    await session.set("fact", fact)
    return "noted"
```

Subclasses `Session` only so the framework's type-based injection detector can
key off it; it adds no behavior of its own.

### `SessionProvider` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/sessions.py#L501" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Provider contributing the session lifecycle tools.

Register it whenever a tool declares a `session_id: SessionId` argument:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.server.sessions import SessionProvider

mcp.add_provider(SessionProvider())
```

It registers two tools:

* `create_session()` mints an unguessable `uuid4`, records the session, and
  returns the id.
* `end_session(session_id)` invalidates that session and deletes its state.

It owns no storage (session state lives in the server's configured
`session_state_store`) and imposes no TTL (retention is the store's). It
exists to mint and end owned session ids. Registration is not enforced: with
no provider, no id can be created, so every `get_session(...)` rejects —
a `session_id` tool without a provider simply cannot resolve a session.
