# caching

# `fastmcp.client.caching`

A client response cache store backed by AsyncKeyValue.

The MCP SDK's client response cache (SEP-2549) reads and writes through a
pluggable `ResponseCacheStore` protocol; the default is a per-client in-memory
LRU. This module adapts that protocol onto the `AsyncKeyValue` key-value
abstraction FastMCP already uses for its other state-management surfaces (the
event store, the OAuth proxy, the response-caching middleware), so a fleet of
FastMCP clients — for example a set of proxy replicas — can share one
Redis-backed response cache.

Because a shared store mingles cached responses across principals, the SDK
requires an explicit `partition` on any custom store (and FastMCP additionally
requires a `target_id`). The partition is folded into every stored key so
entries can never collide or leak across authorization contexts, and the
adapter round-trips each result through a small type-tagged envelope validated
against an allowlist of cacheable result models — a stored value that names an
unknown type is treated as a miss, never imported by name.

Example:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.caching import KeyValueResponseCacheStore
from mcp.client.caching import CacheConfig
from key_value.aio.stores.redis import RedisStore

store = KeyValueResponseCacheStore(storage=RedisStore(url="redis://localhost"))
config = CacheConfig(store=store, partition="tenant-a", target_id="weather-api")
client = Client("https://example.com/mcp", mode="auto", cache=config)
```

## Classes

### `KeyValueResponseCacheStore` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/client/caching.py#L95" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

A `ResponseCacheStore` backed by any `AsyncKeyValue` store.

Implements the SDK client response cache contract (`get`/`set`/`delete`/
`clear`) over the key-value abstraction FastMCP already uses elsewhere, so a
distributed deployment can point every client at one shared backend (memory,
Redis, etc.). Pass an instance as `CacheConfig(store=...)`; the SDK requires
an explicit `partition` on any custom store, and FastMCP additionally
requires a `target_id`.

Each adapter instance owns one collection (`collection`), so `clear()` only
affects its own namespace and never another tenant's data. `clear()` needs
the backend to support collection destruction or key enumeration; against a
backend that supports neither it is a no-op and entries age out by TTL (a
warning is logged once).

The SDK wraps every store call defensively — a raised operation degrades to
a cache miss rather than failing the request — so this adapter does not
re-wrap its own operations.

**Args:**

* `storage`: The `AsyncKeyValue` backend. Defaults to an in-process `MemoryStore`.
* `collection`: Collection namespace for this adapter's entries.

**Methods:**

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
get(self, key: CacheKey) -> CacheEntry | None
```

#### `set` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/client/caching.py#L166" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
set(self, key: CacheKey, entry: CacheEntry) -> None
```

#### `delete` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/client/caching.py#L182" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
delete(self, key: CacheKey) -> None
```

#### `clear` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/client/caching.py#L185" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
clear(self) -> None
```

Clear this adapter's collection only.

Prefers deleting each enumerated key (which leaves the collection
usable), and falls back to whole-collection destruction. Against a
backend that supports neither, this is a no-op (entries age out by TTL)
and a warning is logged once. Either path is scoped to this adapter's
own collection, so a shared store's other tenants are never touched.
