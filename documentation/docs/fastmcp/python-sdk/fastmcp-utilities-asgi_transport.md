# asgi_transport

# `fastmcp.utilities.asgi_transport`

An in-process, full-duplex HTTP transport for driving ASGI applications from httpx.

Ported from the MCP Python SDK's test suite (`tests/interaction/transports/_bridge.py`,
MIT licensed).

`httpx2.ASGITransport` runs the application to completion and only then hands the buffered
response to the caller, so a server that streams its response — as the streamable HTTP
transport's SSE responses do — can never converse with the client mid-request: a
server-initiated request nested inside a still-open call deadlocks.
`StreamingASGITransport` removes that limitation by running the application as a background
task and forwarding every `http.response.body` chunk to the client the moment it is sent.
Everything happens on the one event loop: no sockets, no threads, no sleeps.

The behavioural contract:

* The request body is buffered before the application is invoked (MCP requests are small
  JSON documents); the response streams chunk by chunk.
* Closing the response — or the whole client — delivers `http.disconnect` to the
  application, exactly as a real server sees when its peer goes away.
* An exception the application raises before sending `http.response.start` fails the
  originating request with that same exception. After the response has started, a failure
  is visible to the client only through the response itself (status code, truncated body) —
  the same signal a real server over a real socket would give.

The transport owns an anyio task group for the application tasks; it is opened and closed by
`httpx2.AsyncClient`'s own context manager, so the client must be used as a context manager.
Closing the transport cancels every running application task by default; set
`cancel_on_close=False` to wait for the application's own disconnect handling instead, which
is what the legacy SSE transport relies on for resource cleanup.

## Functions

### `run_asgi_lifespan` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/utilities/asgi_transport.py#L224" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
run_asgi_lifespan(app: ASGIApp) -> AsyncIterator[None]
```

Run an ASGI application's lifespan, driving the protocol as a real server does.

The application's lifespan runs inside a dedicated task for the whole duration of
the context. This matters because a lifespan typically owns cancel scopes and task
groups — anyio requires those to be exited by the task that entered them, which
rules out entering the lifespan on one task and leaving it on another (as a pytest
fixture's setup and teardown phases may do).

**Args:**

* `app`: The ASGI application whose lifespan should run.

**Raises:**

* `RuntimeError`: If the application reports `lifespan.startup.failed`, or reports
  `lifespan.shutdown.failed` (or crashes during shutdown) while the context
  body itself completed successfully. A failure inside the body takes
  precedence and propagates unchanged.

## Classes

### `StreamingASGITransport` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/utilities/asgi_transport.py#L71" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Drive an ASGI application in-process, streaming each response as it is produced.

This is an `httpx2` transport, so it plugs into anything that accepts an
`httpx2.AsyncClient` — including FastMCP's client transports via their
`httpx_client_factory` argument.

**Args:**

* `app`: The ASGI application to drive (e.g. `FastMCP.http_app()`).
* `cancel_on_close`: When True (the default), closing the transport cancels every
  application task still running, so harness teardown can never hang. Set to
  False to wait for the application's own disconnect handling to complete
  instead, which the legacy SSE server transport relies on for cleanup.

**Methods:**

#### `handle_async_request` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/utilities/asgi_transport.py#L128" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
handle_async_request(self, request: httpx2.Request) -> httpx2.Response
```
