# `fastmcp.server.mixins.lifespan`

Lifespan infrastructure for FastMCP Server.

## Classes

### `LifespanMixin` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/mixins/lifespan.py#L39" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

Mixin providing lifespan infrastructure for FastMCP.

**Methods:**

#### `docket` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/mixins/lifespan.py#L43" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
docket(self: FastMCP) -> Docket | None
```

The Docket instance owned by this server, if the tasks extension is active.

Returns the Docket that the tasks extension initialized as the root of a
runtime tree, or None when no task backend is running. Mounted children do
not own their own Docket — they share the root's via `_current_docket`
ContextVar inheritance — so accessing `.docket` on a mounted child
returns None even while its tasks run on the root's Docket.
