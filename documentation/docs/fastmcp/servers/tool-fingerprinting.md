Downstream systems like routers, gateways, and audit loggers often need to detect whether a tool's schema changed between deployments. Rather than each system inventing its own JSON normalization and hashing logic, you can build stable fingerprints from FastMCP's existing API surface.

FastMCP does not define a single "contract hash" because the inclusion policy is necessarily application-specific: some systems care only about the input schema, others include the description, metadata, tags, or version. Instead, this recipe shows how to assemble a fingerprint payload from the parts you care about, then hash it deterministically.

## The Recipe

The two key building blocks are:

* **`tool.key`** — FastMCP's canonical component identity, encoding type, name, and version (e.g. `tool:greet@1.0` or `tool:greet@`)
* **`tool.to_mcp_tool()`** — the protocol-facing tool object that MCP clients see, including the input schema

Combine them into a payload, serialize deterministically, and hash:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import hashlib
import json

from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("demo")


@mcp.tool()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Say hello."""
    return f"Hello {name}"


async def fingerprint_tool(server: FastMCP, tool_name: str) -> str:
    tool = await server.get_tool(tool_name)
    if tool is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Tool {tool_name!r} not found")

    mcp_tool = tool.to_mcp_tool()
    dumped = mcp_tool.model_dump(mode="json", by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)

    payload = {
        "key": tool.key,
        "inputSchema": dumped["inputSchema"],
    }

    canonical = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
    return hashlib.sha256(canonical.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

The fingerprint is stable across process restarts as long as the tool's name, version, and input schema remain the same.

## Why `tool.key`?

`tool.key` is FastMCP's canonical component identity. It encodes the component type, identifier, and version into a single string:

```
tool:greet@1.0    # versioned tool
tool:greet@       # unversioned tool
```

Using `key` rather than just the tool name ensures that two versions of the same tool produce distinct fingerprints, and that a tool and a resource with the same name cannot collide.

## Why `to_mcp_tool()`?

`to_mcp_tool()` returns the protocol-facing representation — the shape that MCP clients actually receive. This matters because routers and gateways typically operate on the protocol layer, not FastMCP internals. The `model_dump(mode="json", by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)` call produces a clean, serializable dictionary using the MCP protocol field names.

## Customizing the Payload

You own the inclusion policy. Add or remove fields depending on what constitutes a "contract" in your system:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def custom_fingerprint(server: FastMCP, tool_name: str) -> str:
    tool = await server.get_tool(tool_name)
    if tool is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Tool {tool_name!r} not found")

    mcp_tool = tool.to_mcp_tool()
    dumped = mcp_tool.model_dump(mode="json", by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)

    # Include description to detect documentation drift
    payload = {
        "key": tool.key,
        "inputSchema": dumped["inputSchema"],
        "description": dumped.get("description"),
    }

    canonical = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
    return hashlib.sha256(canonical.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()
```

Common variations:

| Field          | When to include                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputSchema`  | Always — this is the core contract                                         |
| `description`  | When documentation drift matters (e.g. LLM routing decisions depend on it) |
| `outputSchema` | When downstream consumers validate response shapes                         |
| `annotations`  | When behavioral hints (read-only, destructive) affect routing              |
| `_meta`        | When custom metadata drives policy decisions                               |

## Detecting Schema Drift in CI

Store fingerprints as artifacts and compare between deployments:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import json
import hashlib
from pathlib import Path

from fastmcp import FastMCP


async def generate_manifest(server: FastMCP) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Generate a fingerprint manifest for all tools."""
    manifest = {}

    for tool in await server.list_tools():
        mcp_tool = tool.to_mcp_tool()
        dumped = mcp_tool.model_dump(mode="json", by_alias=True, exclude_none=True)

        payload = {
            "key": tool.key,
            "inputSchema": dumped["inputSchema"],
        }

        canonical = json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
        manifest[tool.key] = hashlib.sha256(canonical.encode("utf-8")).hexdigest()

    return manifest


async def check_drift(server: FastMCP, baseline_path: Path) -> list[str]:
    """Compare current fingerprints against a stored baseline."""
    current = await generate_manifest(server)
    baseline = json.loads(baseline_path.read_text())

    changed = []
    for key, fingerprint in current.items():
        if baseline.get(key) != fingerprint:
            changed.append(key)

    for key in baseline:
        if key not in current:
            changed.append(key)

    return changed
```

Run `generate_manifest` in CI after each build and compare against the previous run. Any differences indicate a schema change that downstream consumers should be aware of.
