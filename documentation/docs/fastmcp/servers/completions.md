# Argument Completion

> Suggest values for prompt arguments and resource template parameters as the user types.

Argument completion lets a server suggest values while a user fills in a prompt argument or a resource template parameter. As the user types, the client sends a `completion/complete` request naming the prompt or template, the argument being completed, and the partial value so far. The server answers with candidate strings, which the client offers as autocomplete suggestions.

This is the server side of the feature. A client requests completions with [`Client.complete()`](/clients/client); this page covers how a server answers.

## Register a completion handler

A server has a single completion handler, registered with the `@mcp.completion` decorator. The handler receives every completion request and switches on which reference and argument is being completed.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.types import PromptReference

mcp = FastMCP("Completion Server")


@mcp.prompt
def write_poem(theme: str) -> str:
    return f"Write a poem about {theme}"


@mcp.completion
def complete(ref, argument, context):
    if isinstance(ref, PromptReference) and ref.name == "write_poem":
        if argument.name == "theme":
            options = ["nature", "love", "adventure"]
            return [o for o in options if o.startswith(argument.value)]
    return None
```

The handler is called with three values:

* `ref`: which component is being completed — a `PromptReference` (carrying the prompt `name`) or a `ResourceTemplateReference` (carrying the template `uri`).
* `argument`: a `CompletionArgument` with the argument `name` and the partial `value` typed so far.
* `context`: an optional `CompletionContext` carrying the values of arguments the user has already supplied (see [Using already-supplied arguments](#using-already-supplied-arguments)).

Filter your candidates against `argument.value` so the suggestions narrow as the user types. Returning `None` means "I have no suggestions for this reference and argument" — the client receives an empty list, which is the correct answer for a reference the server does not recognize.

<Tip>
  Registering a completion handler declares the server's completions capability during the handshake. A server with no handler does not advertise the capability, and a client that checks capabilities before calling will skip completion requests entirely. This works the same way on both the handshake and modern protocol eras.
</Tip>

## Completing resource template parameters

The same handler answers completion for resource template parameters. A `ResourceTemplateReference` identifies the template by its URI template, and `argument.name` is the parameter being completed.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.types import ResourceTemplateReference

mcp = FastMCP("Completion Server")

REPOS = ["fastmcp", "prefect", "marvin"]


@mcp.resource("github://{owner}/{repo}")
def repo_readme(owner: str, repo: str) -> str:
    return f"README for {owner}/{repo}"


@mcp.completion
def complete(ref, argument, context):
    if isinstance(ref, ResourceTemplateReference):
        if ref.uri == "github://{owner}/{repo}" and argument.name == "repo":
            return [r for r in REPOS if r.startswith(argument.value)]
    return None
```

Because a single handler answers for every prompt and template, a server that completes several components branches on `ref` first, then on `argument.name`. Grouping the branches by reference keeps the handler readable as it grows.

## Using already-supplied arguments

Completions often depend on values the user has already entered. A repository suggestion, for example, depends on which owner was chosen. The client sends those resolved values in the completion context, and the handler reads them from `context.arguments`.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.types import ResourceTemplateReference

mcp = FastMCP("Completion Server")

REPOS_BY_OWNER = {
    "prefecthq": ["fastmcp", "prefect", "marvin"],
    "python": ["cpython", "mypy"],
}


@mcp.resource("github://{owner}/{repo}")
def repo_readme(owner: str, repo: str) -> str:
    return f"README for {owner}/{repo}"


@mcp.completion
def complete(ref, argument, context):
    if isinstance(ref, ResourceTemplateReference) and argument.name == "repo":
        owner = context.arguments.get("owner") if context and context.arguments else None
        repos = REPOS_BY_OWNER.get(owner or "", [])
        return [r for r in repos if r.startswith(argument.value)]
    return None
```

Here the suggestions for `repo` are scoped to the `owner` the user already selected. The context is only present once at least one argument has been resolved, so guard against `context` being `None`.

## Returning results

A handler may return any of three things:

* A list of strings — the simplest form, wrapped into a completion response automatically.
* `None` — treated as an empty completion, for references and arguments the handler does not recognize.
* A `Completion` object — when you want to include pagination hints alongside the values.

The MCP protocol caps a single response at 100 values. When more candidates exist, return a `Completion` and set `total` (how many candidates match in all) and `has_more` (whether values were truncated) so the client can indicate that the list is partial.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.types import Completion, PromptReference

mcp = FastMCP("Completion Server")

ALL_CITIES = ["Paris", "Prague", "Portland", "Phoenix", "Perth"]


@mcp.prompt
def pick_city(city: str) -> str:
    return f"Tell me about {city}"


def search_cities(prefix: str) -> list[str]:
    # A real lookup might return thousands of matches; ALL_CITIES stands in.
    return [c for c in ALL_CITIES if c.startswith(prefix)]


@mcp.completion
def complete(ref, argument, context):
    if isinstance(ref, PromptReference) and argument.name == "city":
        matches = search_cities(argument.value)
        return Completion(
            values=matches[:100],
            total=len(matches),
            has_more=len(matches) > 100,
        )
    return None
```

## Accessing the request context

A completion handler may be sync or async, and it can reach the active request through FastMCP's dependency functions the same way any handler does. Use [`get_context()`](/servers/context) to access session information, authentication, or server state while computing suggestions.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.dependencies import get_context
from mcp.types import PromptReference

mcp = FastMCP("Completion Server")


@mcp.completion
async def complete(ref, argument, context):
    ctx = get_context()
    await ctx.debug(f"Completing {argument.name!r} for {ref}")
    ...
```

## Authorization

Completion runs behind the server's connection-level authentication: an unauthenticated client never reaches the handler. It is independent of per-component `auth=`, though. FastMCP does not resolve the referenced prompt or resource template, so a completion request is not filtered by that component's visibility the way `prompts/get` or a resource read is — the single handler answers for whatever reference the client names.

A completion response carries only candidate strings for one argument, never component content or schema, so this exposes nothing about a hidden component on its own. If a handler computes candidates that should themselves be restricted — matching a prompt hidden from unauthorized callers, say — check the auth context inside the handler (via [`get_context()`](/servers/context)) and return `None` when the caller is not permitted.
