# OpenTelemetry

> Native OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed tracing.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <Badge stroke size="lg" icon="gift" iconType="regular" className="version-badge">
            New in version <code>{version}</code>
        </Badge>;
};

FastMCP includes native OpenTelemetry instrumentation for observability. Traces are automatically generated for tool, prompt, resource, resource template, and task management operations, providing visibility into server behavior, request handling, and provider delegation chains.

## How It Works

FastMCP uses the OpenTelemetry API for instrumentation. This means:

* **On by default** - Instrumentation is active out of the box, no opt-in required
* **No overhead when unused** - Without an SDK, all operations are no-ops
* **Bring your own SDK** - You control collection, export, and sampling
* **Works with any OTEL backend** - Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog, New Relic, etc.

Because FastMCP only depends on the OpenTelemetry API, span creation is a no-op until you configure an SDK and exporter — so being on by default costs nothing until you opt into collection.

### Telemetry Modes

<VersionBadge version="4.0.0" />

`FASTMCP_TELEMETRY_MODE` (or `fastmcp.settings.telemetry_mode`) controls how much of the instrumentation is active:

| Mode               | FastMCP spans | Trace context |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| `native` (default) | Emitted       | Propagated    |
| `propagation_only` | Suppressed    | Propagated    |
| `off`              | Suppressed    | Untouched     |

Use `off` to disable FastMCP's instrumentation entirely. No spans are created even if an SDK is configured, and FastMCP leaves the surrounding OpenTelemetry context exactly as it found it.

Use `propagation_only` when another instrumentation layer already owns the MCP span hierarchy — see [Interoperability](#interoperability) below.

## Enabling Telemetry

The easiest way to export traces is using `opentelemetry-instrument`, which configures the SDK automatically:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pip install opentelemetry-distro opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install
```

Then run your server with tracing enabled:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
opentelemetry-instrument \
  --service_name my-fastmcp-server \
  --exporter_otlp_endpoint http://localhost:4317 \
  fastmcp run server.py
```

Or configure via environment variables:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-fastmcp-server
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317

opentelemetry-instrument fastmcp run server.py
```

This works with any OTLP-compatible backend (Jaeger, Zipkin, Grafana Tempo, Datadog, etc.) and requires no changes to your FastMCP code.

## Tracing

FastMCP creates spans for all MCP operations, providing end-to-end visibility into request handling.

### Server Spans

The server creates spans for each operation using [MCP semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/mcp/):

| Span Name            | Description                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tools/call {name}`  | Tool execution (e.g., `tools/call get_weather`)                    |
| `resources/read`     | Resource read (URI in `mcp.resource.uri` attribute, not span name) |
| `prompts/get {name}` | Prompt render (e.g., `prompts/get greeting`)                       |
| `tasks/{operation}`  | Task management (`tasks/get`, `tasks/update`, or `tasks/cancel`)   |

For mounted servers, an additional `delegate {name}` span shows the delegation to the child server.

### Client Spans

The FastMCP client creates spans for outgoing requests with the same naming pattern (`tools/call {name}`, `resources/read`, `prompts/get {name}`, and `tasks/{operation}`).

### Span Hierarchy

Spans form a hierarchy showing the request flow. For mounted servers:

```
tools/call weather_forecast (CLIENT)
  └── tools/call weather_forecast (SERVER, provider=FastMCPProvider)
        └── delegate get_weather (INTERNAL)
              └── tools/call get_weather (SERVER, provider=LocalProvider)
```

For proxy providers connecting to remote servers:

```
tools/call remote_search (CLIENT)
  └── tools/call remote_search (SERVER, provider=ProxyProvider)
        └── [remote server spans via trace context propagation]
```

### Background tasks

Background task traces have two parts:

* Task submission and management requests use normal client-to-server context propagation. `tasks/get`, `tasks/update`, and `tasks/cancel` server spans are descendants of the corresponding FastMCP client spans.
* Deferred execution runs in a Docket worker. Docket records its `CONSUMER` span as a new trace root with a span link to the submission context, rather than making it a child of the submission span. Custom spans created inside the task are children of that worker span.

Span links preserve the causal relationship without forcing worker sampling to inherit the submit trace's sampling decision. Some tracing backends do not display links prominently, so the worker trace may look disconnected even though the link is present.

Frequent status polling can produce more detail than you need. You can drop those client and server spans with a sampler that checks the span name before delegating to `ParentBased`:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.sampling import (
    ALWAYS_ON,
    Decision,
    ParentBased,
    Sampler,
    SamplingResult,
)


class DropTaskPolls(Sampler):
    def __init__(self):
        self._delegate = ParentBased(ALWAYS_ON)

    def should_sample(self, parent_context, trace_id, name, *args, **kwargs):
        if name in {"tasks/get"}:
            return SamplingResult(Decision.DROP)
        return self._delegate.should_sample(
            parent_context,
            trace_id,
            name,
            *args,
            **kwargs,
        )

    def get_description(self):
        return "DropTaskPolls"


provider = TracerProvider(sampler=DropTaskPolls())
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
```

The name check must happen before `ParentBased` delegates. If the name-based sampler is nested inside `ParentBased`, it is not consulted for child spans whose parent was already sampled.

## Interoperability

<VersionBadge version="4.0.0" />

FastMCP assumes it owns the MCP span hierarchy. When something else already owns it — an MCP-aware OpenTelemetry instrumentation library, or a service mesh that understands the protocol — FastMCP's spans duplicate what that layer already emits, and the same request shows up twice in your traces.

Setting `propagation_only` resolves the duplication in FastMCP's favor of the other layer:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
export FASTMCP_TELEMETRY_MODE=propagation_only
```

The distinction from `off` matters here. Both emit no FastMCP spans, but `off` is fully transparent, while `propagation_only` still extracts the trace context arriving in `_meta` and attaches it for the duration of the request. Spans created downstream — by your tool handlers, or by the instrumentation layer that owns the hierarchy — are parented to the calling trace rather than starting a new one. Outbound requests still carry `traceparent` and `tracestate` in `_meta`.

### Suppressing spans for a single block

Library authors embedding FastMCP inside their own instrumented stack often want to own the hierarchy for one specific operation rather than process-wide. `suppress_fastmcp_telemetry()` applies `propagation_only` semantics to a block:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.telemetry import suppress_fastmcp_telemetry

async def search(client: Client, query: str):
    with suppress_fastmcp_telemetry():
        return await client.call_tool("search", {"query": query})
```

This is narrower than OpenTelemetry's global instrumentation suppression: only FastMCP's spans are skipped, so nested instrumentation for HTTP clients, databases, and everything else keeps emitting normally.

The context manager has no effect when `telemetry_mode` is already `off`. A request to skip FastMCP's spans cannot re-enable the context propagation that `off` deliberately omits.

## Programmatic Configuration

For more control, configure the SDK in your Python code before importing FastMCP:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

# Configure the SDK with OTLP exporter
provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317"))
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Now import and use FastMCP - traces will be exported automatically
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("my-server")

@mcp.tool()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

<Tip>
  The SDK must be configured **before** importing FastMCP to ensure the tracer provider is set when FastMCP initializes.
</Tip>

### Local Development

For quick local trace visualization, [otel-desktop-viewer](https://github.com/CtrlSpice/otel-desktop-viewer) is a lightweight single-binary tool:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# macOS
brew install nico-barbas/brew/otel-desktop-viewer

# Or download from GitHub releases
```

Run it alongside your server:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Terminal 1: Start the viewer (UI at http://localhost:8000, OTLP on :4317)
otel-desktop-viewer

# Terminal 2: Run your server with tracing
opentelemetry-instrument fastmcp run server.py
```

For more features, use [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/):

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

Then view traces at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)

## Custom Spans

You can add your own spans using the FastMCP tracer:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.telemetry import get_tracer

mcp = FastMCP("custom-spans")

@mcp.tool()
async def complex_operation(input: str) -> str:
    tracer = get_tracer()

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("parse_input") as span:
        span.set_attribute("input.length", len(input))
        parsed = parse(input)

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("process_data") as span:
        span.set_attribute("data.count", len(parsed))
        result = process(parsed)

    return result
```

### Where custom spans help most

Custom spans are most useful around work that is expensive or hard to debug:

* External calls such as databases, vector stores, HTTP APIs, or queue operations
* Multi-step tool logic where one stage dominates latency
* Prompt or resource generation that fans out to other systems
* LLM calls a tool makes to a model provider

Avoid wrapping every small helper function or simple in-memory transformation. That usually adds noise without making traces easier to interpret.

### Recommended naming and attributes

* Use `{tool_name}.{operation}` or `{resource_name}.{operation}` for child spans such as `search.fetch`, `search.rank`, or `docs.render`
* Add attributes that explain workload shape, such as counts, sizes, cache hits, or IDs
* Do not record secrets, prompts with sensitive user data, or raw tokens as span attributes
* Let exceptions propagate unless you have a specific recovery path; FastMCP's server spans already mark failures and record exceptions

### Instrumenting tools, prompts, and resources

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.telemetry import get_tracer

mcp = FastMCP("my-server")

@mcp.tool
async def search(query: str) -> str:
    tracer = get_tracer()

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("search.fetch") as span:
        span.set_attribute("search.query_length", len(query))
        results = await fetch_results(query)
        span.set_attribute("search.result_count", len(results))

    with tracer.start_as_current_span("search.rank"):
        ranked = rank_results(results)

    return format_results(ranked)

@mcp.prompt
async def summarize_prompt(topic: str) -> str:
    tracer = get_tracer()
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("summarize_prompt.render") as span:
        span.set_attribute("prompt.topic_length", len(topic))
        return f"Summarize the latest updates about {topic}."

@mcp.resource("docs://{slug}")
async def docs_resource(slug: str) -> str:
    tracer = get_tracer()
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("docs_resource.load") as span:
        span.set_attribute("docs.slug", slug)
        return await load_doc(slug)
```

### LLM calls inside tools

A tool that [calls an LLM directly](/servers/sampling) should keep the model work nested under the tool span, so traces show application logic and model latency together.

For providers with their own OTEL integrations, prefer enabling that instrumentation rather than manually creating a span around every model call. For example, if you use Google GenAI, `logfire.instrument_google_genai()` will emit child spans with token and request metadata under the active FastMCP tool span.

### Exporter choices

* For local debugging, `ConsoleSpanExporter` or `otel-desktop-viewer` gives quick feedback with minimal setup
* For shared environments, use OTLP exporters to backends like Logfire, Jaeger, Tempo, Datadog, or New Relic
* If traces are too noisy, tune sampling in your OpenTelemetry SDK instead of removing FastMCP instrumentation

## Error Handling

When errors occur, spans are automatically marked with error status and the exception is recorded:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool()
def risky_operation() -> str:
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong")

# The span will have:
# - status = ERROR with exception message as description
# - error.type = "tool_error" (or exception class name for non-tool errors)
# - exception event with stack trace
```

## Attributes Reference

<Warning>
  **Migrating from v3.1 or earlier:** The `rpc.system`, `rpc.service`, and `rpc.method` span attributes were removed in favor of the [MCP semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/mcp/) listed below. If you have dashboards or alerts keyed on those `rpc.*` attributes, update them to use `mcp.method.name` and the `fastmcp.*` attributes instead.
</Warning>

### MCP Semantic Conventions

FastMCP implements the [OpenTelemetry MCP semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/mcp/):

| Attribute              | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `mcp.protocol.version` | The negotiated MCP protocol version for the request                                            |
| `mcp.session.id`       | Session identifier for the MCP connection                                                      |
| `mcp.resource.uri`     | The resource URI (for resource operations)                                                     |
| `gen_ai.tool.name`     | Tool name (on `tools/call` spans)                                                              |
| `gen_ai.prompt.name`   | Prompt name (on `prompts/get` spans)                                                           |
| `error.type`           | Error classification (`tool_error` for ToolError, otherwise exception class name)              |

### Auth Attributes

Standard [identity attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/attributes-registry/enduser/):

| Attribute       | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `enduser.id`    | Client ID from access token (when authenticated)  |
| `enduser.scope` | Space-separated OAuth scopes (when authenticated) |

### FastMCP Custom Attributes

All custom attributes use the `fastmcp.` prefix for features unique to FastMCP:

| Attribute                | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fastmcp.server.name`    | Server name                                                                                       |
| `fastmcp.component.type` | `tool`, `resource`, `prompt`, or `resource_template`                                              |

| `fastmcp.provider.type`  | Provider class (`LocalProvider`, `FastMCPProvider`, `ProxyProvider`)                              |

Provider-specific attributes for delegation context:

| Attribute                        | Description                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `fastmcp.delegate.original_name` | Original tool/prompt name before namespacing |
| `fastmcp.delegate.original_uri`  | Original resource URI before namespacing     |
| `fastmcp.proxy.backend_name`     | Remote server tool/prompt name               |
| `fastmcp.proxy.backend_uri`      | Remote server resource URI                   |

## Testing with Telemetry

For testing, use the in-memory exporter:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from collections.abc import Generator
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export.in_memory_span_exporter import InMemorySpanExporter

from fastmcp import FastMCP

@pytest.fixture
def trace_exporter() -> Generator[InMemorySpanExporter, None, None]:
    exporter = InMemorySpanExporter()
    provider = TracerProvider()
    provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter))
    original_provider = trace.get_tracer_provider()
    trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
    yield exporter
    exporter.clear()
    trace.set_tracer_provider(original_provider)

async def test_tool_creates_span(trace_exporter: InMemorySpanExporter) -> None:
    mcp = FastMCP("test")

    @mcp.tool()
    def hello() -> str:
        return "world"

    await mcp.call_tool("hello", {})

    spans = trace_exporter.get_finished_spans()
    assert any(s.name == "tools/call hello" for s in spans)
```
