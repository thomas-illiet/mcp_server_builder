# Client Roots

> Tell servers which local paths your client can reach.

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <Badge stroke size="lg" icon="gift" iconType="regular" className="version-badge">
            New in version <code>{version}</code>
        </Badge>;
};

<VersionBadge version="2.0.0" />

Use this when you need to tell servers what local resources the client has access to.

A root is a path your client is willing to expose — a project directory, a workspace, a document store. Servers read them to scope their work, so a tool that searches files searches where you pointed it, and a server that gets no roots has to ask the user for paths instead. Roots describe where the client can reach; the server takes them as its working boundary.

Register them once with `roots=`, and the client answers however the server asks. A handshake-era server pushes a `roots/list` request down the open session and reads the reply mid-call; a modern (`2026-07-28`) server has no such channel, so it returns a roots request and `fastmcp.Client` fulfils it from the same registration and re-issues the call with the answer attached. The default `mode="auto"` negotiates whichever era the server speaks, so the examples below work on either — see [protocol negotiation](/clients/client#protocol-negotiation) for how that choice is made, and [the guard pattern](/servers/elicitation#sampling-and-roots) for how a server issues the modern form.

## Static Roots

When the paths are known up front, pass them as a list. The client holds them for the life of the connection and hands back the same set every time a server asks.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    roots=["file:///path/to/root1", "file:///path/to/root2"]
)
```

## Dynamic Roots

Pass a callback instead when the roots depend on something the client learns at runtime, such as the workspace the user has open. It runs at the moment a server asks, on either route, and receives the request context so you can see which request it is answering:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.roots import RequestContext

async def roots_callback(context: RequestContext) -> list[str]:
    print(f"Server requested roots (Request ID: {context.request_id})")
    return ["file:///path/to/root1", "file:///path/to/root2"]

client = Client(
    "my_mcp_server.py",
    roots=roots_callback
)
```
