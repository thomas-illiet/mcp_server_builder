Good tests are the foundation of reliable software. In FastMCP, we treat tests as first-class documentation that demonstrates how features work while protecting against regressions. Every new capability needs comprehensive tests that demonstrate correctness.

## FastMCP Tests

### Running Tests

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Run all tests
uv run pytest -n auto

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/server/test_auth.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=fastmcp

# Skip integration tests for faster runs
uv run pytest -m "not integration"

# Skip tests that spawn processes
uv run pytest -m "not integration and not client_process and not subprocess_heavy"
```

Tests should complete in under 1 second unless marked as integration tests. This speed encourages running them frequently, catching issues early.

### Test Organization

Our test organization mirrors the source package structure, creating a predictable mapping between code and tests. When you're working on `fastmcp_slim/fastmcp/server/auth.py`, you'll find its tests in `tests/server/test_auth.py`. In rare cases tests are split further - for example, the OpenAPI tests are so comprehensive they're split across multiple files.

### Test Markers

We use pytest markers to categorize tests that require special resources or take longer to run:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from pathlib import Path
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_github_api_integration():
    """Test GitHub API integration with real service."""
    token = os.getenv("FASTMCP_GITHUB_TOKEN")
    if not token:
        pytest.skip("FASTMCP_GITHUB_TOKEN not available")
    
    # Test against real GitHub API
    client = GitHubClient(token)
    repos = await client.list_repos("prefecthq")
    assert "fastmcp" in [repo.name for repo in repos]

@pytest.mark.client_process
async def test_stdio_transport():
    """Test STDIO transport with separate process."""
    # This spawns a subprocess
    async with Client(Path("examples/simple_echo.py")) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("echo", {"message": "test"})
        assert result.content[0].text == "test"
```

A third marker, `subprocess_heavy`, exists specifically for Windows CI stability. See [Windows CI and Test Parallelism](#windows-ci-and-test-parallelism) below for when to use it and why it exists.

### Windows CI and Test Parallelism

Windows CI ran the unit suite serially for months. [#2715](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/2715) tried enabling `pytest-xdist` parallelism there in December 2025; [#2726](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/2726) reverted it the next day because "Windows tests continue to fail with intermittent worker crashes." [#4554](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/4554) re-enabled it after removing most of the subprocess pressure that caused those crashes, taking the Windows unit step from roughly 460s to 175s.

That pressure came from three sources, all addressed by #4554: most HTTP tests moved in-process via `asgi_client` instead of binding real sockets, stdio lifecycle tests spawn a minimal stdlib responder (`tests/client/minimal_stdio_server.py`, \~0.03s to start) instead of a subprocess that runs `import fastmcp` (\~0.7s), and roughly 80 real `sleep()` calls became deterministic waits on the condition each test actually cared about. Fewer, cheaper subprocesses competing under parallel workers left fewer chances for a worker to die.

#### The `subprocess_heavy` marker

One class of test still spawns a full Python interpreter that imports FastMCP — checking that a bare install doesn't need optional dependencies, or that a decorator works from a fresh process. Each spawn pays a full interpreter's startup and memory footprint, and a 2-core Windows runner already running 2 xdist workers has little headroom left to absorb that. These tests carry `@pytest.mark.subprocess_heavy` and run in the existing serial `client_process` CI step instead of alongside the parallel workers — `.github/actions/run-pytest/action.yml` routes `client_process or subprocess_heavy` to that step (`MAX_PROCS=0`) and excludes both markers from the parallel unit step.

If a test runs `subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-c", ...])`, or otherwise starts a fresh interpreter that imports `fastmcp`, mark it `subprocess_heavy`. A subprocess that runs a minimal stdlib script with no FastMCP import doesn't need the marker — it's the interpreter startup and import that's expensive, not the subprocess itself.

#### This is a mitigation, not a proof

There is no root-cause diagnosis behind this fix, only a plausible one. During validation, one Windows run genuinely crashed a worker on `test_fastmcp_imports_without_legacy_httpx` — a fresh-interpreter test — with pytest-xdist reporting `worker 'gw1' crashed while running '...'` after execnet's channel saw `ConnectionResetError: [WinError 10054]`. Nothing in that log says *why* the worker died: memory exhaustion, handle exhaustion, and some Windows-specific `subprocess`/`execnet` interaction are all still consistent with what was observed. Marking the fresh-interpreter tests `subprocess_heavy` made the crash stop recurring, but "it stopped" is not the same as "we know why."

Treat the next Windows worker crash as a test of this diagnosis. **If it lands on a test that is not a fresh-interpreter spawner, the `subprocess_heavy` theory was wrong** — the real problem is subprocess-under-xdist on Windows more generally, and isolating one marker's worth of tests was never going to fix that. The fallback is one conditional back in `run-pytest/action.yml`, restoring the pre-#4554 behavior:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
PARALLEL_FLAGS=""
if [ "$MAX_PROCS" != "0" ] && [ "${{ runner.os }}" != "Windows" ]; then
  PARALLEL_FLAGS="--numprocesses auto --maxprocesses $MAX_PROCS --dist worksteal"
fi
```

#### Two traps that aren't Windows-specific

Two test-authoring bugs surfaced while validating this change. Neither is about Windows or parallelism, but both are worth watching for anywhere a real `sleep()` gets replaced with a wait:

* **Match the wait condition to the assertion.** A test waited for "any callback fired," then asserted that a `completed` callback existed. That races, because an earlier `working` notification satisfies the wait before the `completed` one arrives. A deterministic wait is only as good as the condition it waits on — wait for the thing you actually assert.
* **Don't assert on incidental timing.** A crash-recovery test asserted "at least one concurrent request fails" while a subprocess restarts, which quietly depended on the restart being slow. Once restart got faster, recovery could beat every in-flight request and the test started failing because the behavior *improved*. Assert the invariant instead: no hang, and no result served by the dead process.

## Writing Tests

### Test Requirements

Following these practices creates maintainable, debuggable test suites that serve as both documentation and regression protection.

#### Single Behavior Per Test

Each test should verify exactly one behavior. When it fails, you need to know immediately what broke. A test that checks five things gives you five potential failure points to investigate. A test that checks one thing points directly to the problem.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Good: Atomic Test theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  async def test_tool_registration():
      """Test that tools are properly registered with the server."""
      mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
      
      @mcp.tool
      def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
          return a + b
      
      tools = mcp.list_tools()
      assert len(tools) == 1
      assert tools[0].name == "add"
  ```

  ```python Bad: Multi-Behavior Test theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  async def test_server_functionality():
      """Test multiple server features at once."""
      mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
      
      # Tool registration
      @mcp.tool
      def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
          return a + b
      
      # Resource creation
      @mcp.resource("config://app")
      def get_config():
          return {"version": "1.0"}
      
      # Authentication setup
      mcp.auth = BearerTokenProvider({"token": "user"})
      
      # What exactly are we testing? If this fails, what broke?
      assert mcp.list_tools()
      assert mcp.list_resources()
      assert mcp.auth is not None
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Self-Contained Setup

Every test must create its own setup. Tests should be runnable in any order, in parallel, or in isolation. When a test fails, you should be able to run just that test to reproduce the issue.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Good: Self-Contained theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  async def test_tool_execution_with_error():
      """Test that tool errors are properly handled."""
      mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
      
      @mcp.tool
      def divide(a: int, b: int) -> float:
          if b == 0:
              raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
          return a / b
      
      async with Client(mcp) as client:
          with pytest.raises(Exception):
              await client.call_tool("divide", {"a": 10, "b": 0})
  ```

  ```python Bad: Test Dependencies theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  # Global state that tests depend on
  test_server = None

  def test_setup_server():
      """Setup for other tests."""
      global test_server
      test_server = FastMCP("shared-server")

  def test_server_works():
      """Test server functionality."""
      # Depends on test_setup_server running first
      assert test_server is not None
  ```
</CodeGroup>

#### Clear Intent

Test names and assertions should make the verified behavior obvious. A developer reading your test should understand what feature it validates and how that feature should behave.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def test_authenticated_tool_requires_valid_token():
    """Test that authenticated users can access protected tools."""
    mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
    mcp.auth = BearerTokenProvider({"secret-token": "test-user"})
    
    @mcp.tool
    def protected_action() -> str:
        return "success"
    
    async with Client(mcp, auth=BearerAuth("secret-token")) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("protected_action", {})
        assert result.content[0].text == "success"
```

#### Using Fixtures

Use fixtures to create reusable data, server configurations, or other resources for your tests. Note that you should **not** open FastMCP clients in your fixtures as it can create hard-to-diagnose issues with event loops.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

@pytest.fixture
def weather_server():
    server = FastMCP("WeatherServer")
    
    @server.tool
    def get_temperature(city: str) -> dict:
        temps = {"NYC": 72, "LA": 85, "Chicago": 68}
        return {"city": city, "temp": temps.get(city, 70)}
    
    return server

async def test_temperature_tool(weather_server):
    async with Client(weather_server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("get_temperature", {"city": "LA"})
        assert result.data == {"city": "LA", "temp": 85}
```

#### Effective Assertions

Assertions should be specific and provide context on failure. When a test fails during CI, the assertion message should tell you exactly what went wrong.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Basic assertion - minimal context on failure
assert result.status == "success"

# Better - explains what was expected
assert result.status == "success", f"Expected successful operation, got {result.status}: {result.error}"
```

Try not to have too many assertions in a single test unless you truly need to check various aspects of the same behavior. In general, assertions of different behaviors should be in separate tests.

#### Inline Snapshots

FastMCP uses `inline-snapshot` for testing complex data structures. On first run of `pytest --inline-snapshot=create` with an empty `snapshot()`, pytest will auto-populate the expected value. To update snapshots after intentional changes, run `pytest --inline-snapshot=fix`. This is particularly useful for testing JSON schemas and API responses.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from inline_snapshot import snapshot

async def test_tool_schema_generation():
    """Test that tool schemas are generated correctly."""
    mcp = FastMCP("test-server")
    
    @mcp.tool
    def calculate_tax(amount: float, rate: float = 0.1) -> dict:
        """Calculate tax on an amount."""
        return {"amount": amount, "tax": amount * rate, "total": amount * (1 + rate)}
    
    tools = mcp.list_tools()
    schema = tools[0].input_schema
    
    # First run: snapshot() is empty, gets auto-populated
    # Subsequent runs: compares against stored snapshot
    assert schema == snapshot({
        "type": "object", 
        "properties": {
            "amount": {"type": "number"}, 
            "rate": {"type": "number", "default": 0.1}
        }, 
        "required": ["amount"]
    })
```

### In-Memory Testing

FastMCP uses in-memory transport for testing, where servers and clients communicate directly. The majority of functionality can be tested in a deterministic fashion this way. We use more complex setups only when testing transports themselves.

The in-memory transport runs the real MCP protocol implementation without network overhead. Instead of deploying your server or managing network connections, you pass your server instance directly to the client. Everything runs in the same Python process - you can set breakpoints anywhere and step through with your debugger.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

# Create your server
server = FastMCP("WeatherServer")

@server.tool
def get_temperature(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get current temperature for a city"""
    temps = {"NYC": 72, "LA": 85, "Chicago": 68}
    return {"city": city, "temp": temps.get(city, 70)}

async def test_weather_operations():
    # Pass server directly - no deployment needed
    async with Client(server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("get_temperature", {"city": "NYC"})
        assert result.data == {"city": "NYC", "temp": 72}
```

This pattern makes tests deterministic and fast - typically completing in milliseconds rather than seconds.

### Mocking External Dependencies

FastMCP servers are standard Python objects, so you can mock external dependencies using your preferred approach:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

async def test_database_tool():
    server = FastMCP("DataServer")
    
    # Mock the database
    mock_db = AsyncMock()
    mock_db.fetch_users.return_value = [
        {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"},
        {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}
    ]
    
    @server.tool
    async def list_users() -> list:
        return await mock_db.fetch_users()
    
    async with Client(server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("list_users", {})
        assert len(result.data) == 2
        assert result.data[0]["name"] == "Alice"
        mock_db.fetch_users.assert_called_once()
```

### Testing Network Transports

In-memory testing covers most unit testing needs, but some behavior only exists over HTTP: middleware, authentication, session management, header handling, and SSE streaming. To test those, serve your server over HTTP with `asgi_client`.

#### Testing Over HTTP

<VersionBadge version="3.5.0" />

`asgi_client` builds your server's real Starlette app, starts its lifespan, and hands you a connected `Client` that talks to it over the full HTTP stack. The one thing it skips is the socket: requests are dispatched straight into the ASGI application on the current event loop, so there is no port to bind, no uvicorn to start, and no connection to negotiate. Everything else — middleware, authentication, session management, SSE framing — runs exactly as it does in production.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.utilities.tests import asgi_client

def create_test_server() -> FastMCP:
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")

    @server.tool
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    return server

async def test_greet_over_http():
    async with asgi_client(create_test_server()) as client:
        greeting = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        assert greeting.data == "Hello, World!"
```

Pass `transport="sse"` to exercise the SSE app instead of streamable HTTP, `path=` to serve on a custom path, `headers=` and `auth=` to configure the client's requests, and any other keyword argument to configure the `Client` itself.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def test_tenant_header_is_visible_to_tools():
    async with asgi_client(
        create_test_server(),
        headers={"X-Tenant-ID": "acme"},
        timeout=5,
    ) as client:
        await client.list_tools()
```

#### Sharing One Server Across Tests

When several tests share a server but each needs its own client, use `asgi_server` in a fixture. It yields an `ASGIServer`, whose `client()` method produces a fresh client — with its own session — on demand.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.utilities.tests import ASGIServer, asgi_server

@pytest.fixture
async def http_server():
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")

    @server.tool
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

    async with asgi_server(server) as running_server:
        yield running_server

async def test_greet(http_server: ASGIServer):
    async with http_server.client() as client:
        greeting = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
        assert greeting.data == "Hello, World!"

async def test_sessions_are_isolated(http_server: ASGIServer):
    async with (
        http_server.client(mode="legacy") as first,
        http_server.client(mode="legacy") as second,
    ):
        assert await first.ping() is True
        assert await second.ping() is True
```

Sessions belong to the handshake era of the MCP protocol, and so does `ping`, so a test that is about session behavior pins `mode="legacy"`. Every keyword argument `client()` doesn't consume itself is passed straight to `Client`. See [protocol negotiation](/clients/client#protocol-negotiation).

For assertions about raw HTTP — status codes, response headers, metadata endpoints — `http_client()` returns an `httpx.AsyncClient` bound to the same app. Because nothing is listening on the network, this is the only way to make raw requests; a plain `httpx.AsyncClient()` cannot reach the server.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
async def test_unauthenticated_request_is_rejected(http_server: ASGIServer):
    async with http_server.http_client() as http:
        response = await http.post(http_server.url, json={"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1})
        assert response.status_code in (400, 401)
```

If you need to build the client transport yourself, `transport()` returns a `StreamableHttpTransport` or `SSETransport` already wired to the in-process app.

#### Testing on a Real Port

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

`run_server_async` starts a real uvicorn server on a real TCP port as a task in the current process and yields its URL. Reach for it only when the subject of the test is the network itself — real sockets, TLS, or a server that must be reachable by something other than an in-process client.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.utilities.tests import run_server_async

async def test_server_binds_a_real_port():
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")

    async with run_server_async(server) as url:
        assert url.startswith("http://127.0.0.1:")
        async with Client(url) as client:
            assert await client.list_tools() == []
```

#### Subprocess Testing (Special Cases)

For tests that require complete process isolation (like STDIO transport or testing subprocess behavior), use `run_server_in_process`:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
import pytest
from fastmcp.utilities.tests import run_server_in_process
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import StreamableHttpTransport

def run_server(host: str, port: int) -> None:
    """Function to run in subprocess."""
    server = FastMCP("TestServer")
    
    @server.tool
    def greet(name: str) -> str:
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    
    server.run(host=host, port=port)

@pytest.fixture
async def http_server():
    """Fixture that runs server in subprocess."""
    with run_server_in_process(run_server, transport="http") as url:
        yield f"{url}/mcp"

async def test_http_transport(http_server: str):
    """Test actual HTTP transport behavior."""
    async with Client(
        transport=StreamableHttpTransport(http_server)
    ) as client:
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        assert "greet" in [tool.name for tool in tools]
```

The `run_server_in_process` utility handles server lifecycle, port allocation, and cleanup automatically. Use this only when subprocess isolation is truly necessary, as it's slower and harder to debug than in-process testing. FastMCP uses the `client_process` marker to isolate these tests in CI.

### Documentation Testing

Documentation requires the same validation as code. The `just docs` command launches a local Mintlify server that renders your documentation exactly as users will see it:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Start local documentation server with hot reload
just docs

# Or run Mintlify directly
mintlify dev
```

The local server watches for changes and automatically refreshes. This preview catches formatting issues and helps you see documentation as users will experience it.
