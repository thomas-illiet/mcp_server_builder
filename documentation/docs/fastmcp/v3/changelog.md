<Update label="v3.4.4" description="2026-07-08">
  **[v3.4.4: Host in Translation](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.4.4)**

  FastMCP 3.4.4 restores HTTP deployment compatibility after the 3.4.3 Host/Origin guard changed default behavior for existing ASGI, serverless, and reverse-proxy deployments. The guard implementation remains available for deployments that opt in with explicit trusted hosts and origins, while 3.x returns to accepting traffic that worked before the patch. This release also adds Hugging Face OAuth provider support, with docs and examples for public and private apps, PKCE, Dynamic Client Registration, and CIMD.

  ### Enhancements ✨

  * Hugging Face Auth Integration by [@evalstate](https://github.com/evalstate) in [#4385](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/4385)

<Update label="v3.4.3" description="2026-07-05">
  **[v3.4.3: The Fast and the Secure-ious](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.4.3)**

  FastMCP 3.4.3 closes out a month of SSRF and OAuth hardening: NAT64, 6to4, Teredo, and ISATAP transition addresses can no longer smuggle private IPv4 targets past the SSRF allow-list, Streamable HTTP now validates Host and Origin before session handling to block DNS rebinding against localhost-bound servers, and OAuth redirect validation rejects unsafe schemes and unregistered DCR redirect URIs. Alongside the security work, this release also fixes proxy session teardown races, discriminator-tag handling in JSON schema conversion, and several smaller reliability issues.

</Update>

<Update label="v3.4.2" description="2026-06-06">
  **[v3.4.2: Heads Up](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.4.2)**

  FastMCP 3.4.2 restores JWT compatibility for providers that include private, non-critical JWS header parameters. Tokens from providers like Clerk can carry header metadata such as `cat` without being rejected before signature and claim validation, while unsupported critical headers are still rejected.

  ### Fixes 🐞

  * Allow private JWT headers by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#4290](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/4290)

  ### Docs 📚

<Update label="v3.4.1" description="2026-06-05">
  **[v3.4.1: Floor It](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.4.1)**

  FastMCP 3.4.1 floors Starlette at `>=1.0.1` so installs can no longer resolve to a version affected by CVE-2026-48710, which was previously only constrained transitively through `mcp`. It also makes OAuthProxy log refresh-token cache misses instead of failing silently.

  ### Enhancements ✨

  * Log refresh-token misses in OAuthProxy instead of failing silently by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#4276](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/4276)

  ### Security 🔒

<Update label="v3.4.0" description="2026-06-02">
  **[v3.4.0: Remote Control](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.4.0)**

  FastMCP 3.4 is about reaching servers that live somewhere else. The headline is `fastmcp-remote`, a standalone bridge that connects stdio-only MCP hosts to servers hosted over HTTP. Around it, the proxy layer those connections depend on is hardened: a proxy now forwards `initialize` upstream and fails loudly when the backend is missing or misconfigured, instead of reporting a connected-but-empty proxy. And FastMCP-issued access tokens can now outlive short-lived upstream tokens, so authenticated sessions survive the long idle periods remote clients are prone to.

  ### New Features 🎉

  * Add fastmcp-remote bridge package by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#4208](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/4208)

</Update>

<Update label="v3.3.1" description="2026-05-15">
  **[v3.3.1: Loop There It Is](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.3.1)**

  A hotfix for the 3.3 packaging split. Clean installs could fail on standalone component imports like `from fastmcp.tools import tool`, because component modules reached auth and task primitives through `fastmcp.server` and pulled in the full server/provider stack. Those primitives now live in lightweight utility modules, with the old server import paths preserved as compatibility re-exports.

  ### Fixes 🐞

  **[v3.3.0: Slim Reaper](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.3.0)**

  FastMCP 3.3 ships `fastmcp-slim`, a dependency-light distribution that separates the client from the server stack — install FastMCP's client and transport layer without Starlette, Uvicorn, or the rest of the server machinery. The import namespace is unchanged. It also closes out a backlog of OAuth proxy security hardening, MCP-compliant OTEL instrumentation, and auth additions that accumulated through the 3.2 cycle.

  **Full Changelog**: [v3.2.4...v3.3.0](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/compare/v3.2.4...v3.3.0)
</Update>

<Update label="v3.2.4" description="2026-04-14">
  **[v3.2.4: Patch Me If You Can](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.2.4)**

  A grab bag of fixes, hardening, and polish. The headline behavior change: background tasks are now scoped to the authorization context rather than the MCP session, so a task survives session churn and stays tied to who started it — a breaking change for anyone relying on the old session-scoped semantics. Plus actual-size validation in `FileUpload`, a Keycloak OAuth provider, automatic parameter descriptions from docstrings, and dozens of schema and sampling fixes.

<Update label="v3.2.3" description="2026-04-09">
  **[v3.2.3: Redis or Not](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.2.3)**

  A stopgap pin: fakeredis 2.35.0 shipped an undocumented rename that broke pydocket's `memory://` backend, causing `fastmcp[tasks]` installs to fail at startup with an `ImportError`. This pins `fakeredis<2.35.0` in the `tasks` extra until a fixed pydocket ships.

  ### Fixes 🐞

  * Pin `fakeredis<2.35.0` in tasks extra by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#3804](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/3804)

<Update label="v3.2.2" description="2026-04-09">
  **[v3.2.2: Audience Appreciation](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.2.2)**

  Fixes the Azure audience regression from 3.2.1: validation switched from `client_id` to `identifier_uri`, which fixed custom Application ID URIs but broke the default case where Azure AD v2 tokens set `aud` to the bare client ID GUID. Both formats are now accepted.

  ### Fixes 🐞

  * fix: accept both client\_id and identifier\_uri as Azure audience by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#3797](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/3797)

<Update label="v3.2.1" description="2026-04-08">
  **[v3.2.1: Audience Participation](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.2.1)**

  A patch focused on auth-provider audience validation. Cognito tokens now validate on `client_id` (they carry no `aud`), Azure honors the `identifier_uri` parameter for Entra v2.0 tokens, and consent cookies are LRU-capped to prevent unbounded growth past reverse proxy header limits. Also fixes OpenAPI 3.0 `nullable` fields leaking into tool input schemas and server-variable substitution in base URLs.

  ### Breaking Changes ⚠️

</Update>

<Update label="v3.2.0" description="2026-03-30">
  **[v3.2.0: Show Don't Tool](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.2.0)**

  FastMCP 3.2 is the Apps release: your tools can now return interactive UIs — charts, dashboards, forms, maps — rendered right inside the conversation. `FastMCPApp` separates the tools the LLM sees from the backend tools the UI calls, five built-in providers (FileUpload, Approval, Choice, FormInput, GenerativeUI) cover common interaction patterns, and `fastmcp dev apps` gives you a browser preview. The release also lands a significant security hardening pass across SSRF/path-traversal, JWT algorithm restrictions, OAuth scope enforcement, and CSRF.

  **Full Changelog**: [v3.1.0...v3.2.0](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0)
</Update>

<Update label="v3.1.1" description="2026-03-14">
  **[v3.1.1: 'Tis But a Patch](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.1.1)**

  Pins `pydantic-monty` below 0.0.8 to fix a breaking change in Monty that affects code mode. Monty 0.0.8 removed the `external_functions` constructor parameter, causing `MontySandboxProvider` to fail. This patch caps the version so existing installs work correctly.

  ### Fixes 🐞

  * Pin pydantic-monty below 0.0.8 to fix code mode by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#3497](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/3497)

  **[v3.1.0: Code to Joy](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.1.0)**

  FastMCP 3.1 is the Code Mode release.

  **[v3.0.1: Three-covery Mode](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.0.1)**

  First patch after 3.0 — mostly smoothing out rough edges discovered in the wild. The big ones: middleware state that wasn't surviving the trip to tool handlers now does, `Tool.from_tool()` accepts callables again, OpenAPI schemas with circular references no longer crash discovery, and decorator overloads now return the correct types in function mode. Also adds `verify_id_token` to OIDCProxy for providers (like some Azure AD configs) that issue opaque access tokens but standard JWT id\_tokens.

</Update>

<Update label="v3.0.0" description="2026-02-18">
  **[v3.0.0: Three at Last](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.0.0)**

  FastMCP 3.0 is stable. Two betas, two release candidates, 21 new contributors, and more than 100,000 pre-release installs later — the architecture held up, the upgrade path was smooth, and we're shipping it.

  The surface API is largely unchanged — `@mcp.tool()` still works exactly as before. What changed is everything underneath: a provider/transform architecture that makes FastMCP extensible, observable, and composable in ways v2 couldn't support. If we did our jobs right, you'll barely notice the redesign. You'll just notice that more is possible.

  This is also the release where FastMCP moves from [jlowin/fastmcp](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) to [PrefectHQ/fastmcp](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp). GitHub forwards all links, PyPI is the same, imports are the same. A major version felt like the right moment to make it official.

  ### Build servers from anything

  🔌 Components no longer have to live in one file with one server. `FileSystemProvider` discovers tools from directories with hot-reload. `OpenAPIProvider` wraps REST APIs. `ProxyProvider` proxies remote MCP servers. `SkillsProvider` delivers agent skills as resources. Write your own provider for whatever source makes sense. Compose multiple providers into one server, share one across many, or chain them with **transforms** that rename, namespace, filter, version, and secure components as they flow to clients. `ResourcesAsTools` and `PromptsAsTools` expose non-tool components to tool-only clients.

  ### Ship to production

  🔐 Component versioning: serve `@tool(version="2.0")` alongside older versions from one codebase. Granular authorization on individual components with async auth checks, server-wide policies via `AuthMiddleware`, and scope-based access control. OAuth gets CIMD, Static Client Registration, Azure OBO via dependency injection, JWT audience validation, and confused-deputy protections. OpenTelemetry tracing with MCP semantic conventions. Response size limiting. Background tasks with distributed Redis notification and `ctx.elicit()` relay. Security fixes include dropping `diskcache` (CVE-2025-69872) and upgrading `python-multipart` and `protobuf` for additional CVEs.

  ### Adapt per session

  💾 Session state persists across requests via `ctx.set_state()` / `ctx.get_state()`. `ctx.enable_components()` and `ctx.disable_components()` let servers adapt dynamically per client — show admin tools after authentication, progressively reveal capabilities, or scope access by role.

  ### Develop faster

  ⚡ `--reload` auto-restarts on file changes. Standalone decorators return the original function, so decorated tools stay callable in tests and non-MCP contexts. Sync functions auto-dispatch to a threadpool. Tool timeouts, MCP-compliant pagination, composable lifespans, `PingMiddleware` for keepalive, and concurrent tool execution when the LLM returns multiple calls in one response.

  ### Use FastMCP as a CLI

  🖥️ `fastmcp list` and `fastmcp call` query and invoke tools on any server from a terminal. `fastmcp discover` scans your editor configs (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Goose, Gemini CLI) and finds configured servers by name. `fastmcp generate-cli` writes a standalone typed CLI where every tool is a subcommand. `fastmcp install` registers your server with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Goose in one command.

  ### Build apps (3.1 preview)

  📱 Spec-level support for MCP Apps is in: `ui://` resource scheme, typed UI metadata via `AppConfig`, extension negotiation, and runtime detection. The full Apps experience lands in 3.1.

  ***

  If you hit 3.0 because you didn't pin your dependencies and something breaks — the [upgrade guides](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-fastmcp-2) will get you sorted. We minimized breaking changes, but a major version is a major version.

  ```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}

  **Full Changelog**: [https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/compare/v2.14.5...v3.0.0](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/compare/v2.14.5...v3.0.0)
</Update>

<Update label="v3.0.0rc1" description="2026-02-12">
  **[v3.0.0rc1: RC-ing is Believing](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.0.0rc1)**

  FastMCP 3 RC1 means we believe the API is stable. Beta 2 drew a wave of real-world adoption — production deployments, migration reports, integration testing — and the feedback overwhelmingly confirmed that the architecture works. This release closes gaps that surfaced under load: auth flows that needed to be async, background tasks that needed reliable notification delivery, and APIs still carrying beta-era naming. If nothing unexpected surfaces, this is what 3.0.0 looks like.

  🚨 **Breaking Changes** — The `ui=` parameter is now `app=` with a unified `AppConfig` class (matching the feature's actual name), and 16 `FastMCP()` constructor kwargs have finally been removed. If you've been ignoring months of deprecation warnings, you'll get a `TypeError` with specific migration instructions.

  🔐 **Auth Improvements** — Three changes that together round out FastMCP's auth story for production. `auth=` checks can now be `async`, so you can hit databases or external services during authorization — previously, passing an async function silently passed because the unawaited coroutine was truthy. Static Client Registration lets clients provide a pre-registered `client_id`/`client_secret` directly, bypassing DCR for servers that don't support it. And Azure OBO flows are now declarative via dependency injection:

  ```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.azure import EntraOBOToken

  @mcp.tool()
  async def get_emails(
      graph_token: str = EntraOBOToken(["https://graph.microsoft.com/Mail.Read"]),
  ):
      # OBO exchange already happened — just use the token
      ...
  ```

  ⚡ **Concurrent Sampling** — When an LLM returns multiple tool calls in a single response, `context.sample()` can now execute them in parallel. Opt in with `tool_concurrency=0` for unlimited parallelism, or set a bound. Tools that aren't safe to parallelize can declare `sequential=True`.

  📡 **Background Task Notifications** — Background tasks now reliably push progress updates and elicit user input through the standard MCP protocol. A distributed Redis queue replaces polling (7,200 round-trips/hour → one blocking call), and `ctx.elicit()` in background tasks automatically relays through the client's standard `elicitation_handler`.

  ✅ **OpenAPI Output Validation** — When backends don't conform to their own OpenAPI schemas, the MCP SDK rejects the response and the tool fails. `validate_output=False` disables strict schema checking while still passing structured JSON to clients — a necessary escape hatch for imperfect APIs.

</Update>

<Update label="v3.0.0b2" description="2026-02-07">
  **[v3.0.0b2: 2 Fast 2 Beta](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.0.0b2)**

  FastMCP 3 Beta 2 reflects the huge number of people that kicked the tires on Beta 1. Seven new contributors landed changes in this release, and early migration reports went smoother than expected, including teams on Prefect Horizon upgrading from v2. Most of Beta 2 is refinement: fixing what people found, filling gaps from real usage, hardening edges. But a few new features did land along the way.

  🖥️ **Client CLI** — `fastmcp list`, `fastmcp call`, `fastmcp discover`, and `fastmcp generate-cli` turn any MCP server into something you can poke at from a terminal. Discover servers configured in Claude Desktop, Cursor, Goose, or project-level `mcp.json` files and reference them by name. `generate-cli` reads a server's schemas and writes a standalone typed CLI script where every tool is a proper subcommand with flags and help text.

  🔐 **CIMD** (Client ID Metadata Documents) adds an alternative to Dynamic Client Registration for OAuth. Clients host a static JSON document at an HTTPS URL; that URL becomes the `client_id`. Server-side support includes SSRF-hardened fetching, cache-aware revalidation, and `private_key_jwt` validation. Enabled by default on `OAuthProxy`.

  📱 **MCP Apps** — Spec-level compliance for the MCP Apps extension: `ui://` resource scheme, typed UI metadata on tools and resources, extension negotiation, and `ctx.client_supports_extension()` for runtime detection.

  ⏳ **Background Task Context** — `Context` now works transparently in Docket workers. `ctx.elicit()` routes through Redis-based coordination so background tasks can pause for user input without any code changes.

  🛡️ **ResponseLimitingMiddleware** caps tool response sizes with UTF-8-safe truncation for text and schema-aware error handling for structured outputs.

  🪿 **Goose Integration** — `fastmcp install goose` generates deeplink URLs for one-command server installation into Goose.

  **Full Changelog**: [https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/compare/v3.0.0b1...v3.0.0b2](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/compare/v3.0.0b1...v3.0.0b2)
</Update>

<Update label="v3.0.0b1" description="2026-01-20">
  **[v3.0.0b1: This Beta Work](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v3.0.0b1)**

  FastMCP 3.0 rebuilds the framework around three primitives: components, providers, and transforms. Providers source components dynamically—from decorators, filesystems, OpenAPI specs, remote servers, or anywhere else. Transforms modify components as they flow to clients—renaming, namespacing, filtering, securing. The features that required specialized subsystems in v2 now compose naturally from these building blocks.

  🔌 **Provider Architecture** unifies how components are sourced. `FileSystemProvider` discovers decorated functions from directories with optional hot-reload. `SkillsProvider` exposes agent skill files as MCP resources. `OpenAPIProvider` and `ProxyProvider` get cleaner integrations. Providers are composable—share one across servers, or attach many to one server.

  🔄 **Transforms** add middleware for components. Namespace mounted servers, rename verbose tools, filter by version, control visibility—all without touching source code. `ResourcesAsTools` and `PromptsAsTools` expose non-tool components to tool-only clients.

  📋 **Component Versioning** lets you register `@tool(version="2.0")` alongside older versions. Clients see the highest version by default but can request specific versions. `VersionFilter` serves different API versions from one codebase.

  💾 **Session-Scoped State** persists across requests. `await ctx.set_state()` and `await ctx.get_state()` now survive the full session. Per-session visibility via `ctx.enable_components()` lets servers adapt dynamically to each client.

  ⚡ **DX Improvements** include `--reload` for auto-restart during development, automatic threadpool dispatch for sync functions, tool timeouts, pagination for large component lists, and OpenTelemetry tracing.

  🔐 **Component Authorization** via `@tool(auth=require_scopes("admin"))` and `AuthMiddleware` for server-wide policies.

  Breaking changes are minimal: for most servers, updating the import statement is all you need. See the [migration guide](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/upgrading/from-fastmcp-2.mdx) for details.

  **[v2.14.7: Fake It Till You Break It](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.14.7)**

  A 2.x backport of the fakeredis pin: fakeredis 2.35.0 renamed a connection class that pydocket's `memory://` backend depended on, crashing `fastmcp[tasks]` installs at startup. This caps `fakeredis<2.35.0` on the 2.x line.

  **[v2.14.1: 'Tis a Gift to Be Sample](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.14.1)**

  FastMCP 2.14.1 introduces sampling with tools (SEP-1577), enabling servers to pass tools to `ctx.sample()` for agentic workflows where the LLM can automatically execute tool calls in a loop. The new `ctx.sample_step()` method provides single LLM calls that return `SampleStep` objects for custom control flow, while `result_type` enables structured outputs via validated Pydantic models.

  🤖 **AnthropicSamplingHandler** joins the existing OpenAI handler, providing multi-provider sampling support out of the box.

  **[v2.14.0: Task and You Shall Receive](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.14.0)**

  FastMCP 2.14 begins adopting the MCP 2025-11-25 specification, introducing protocol-native background tasks (SEP-1686) that enable long-running operations to report progress without blocking clients. The experimental OpenAPI parser graduates to standard, the `OpenAISamplingHandler` is promoted from experimental, and deprecated APIs accumulated across the 2.x series are removed.

  ⏳ **Background Tasks** let you add `task=True` to any async tool decorator to run operations in the background with progress tracking. Powered by [Docket](https://github.com/chrisguidry/docket), an enterprise task scheduler handling millions of concurrent tasks daily—in-memory backends work out-of-the-box, and Redis URLs enable persistence and horizontal scaling.

  🔧 **OpenAPI Parser Promoted** from experimental to standard with improved performance through single-pass schema processing and cleaner abstractions.

  📋 **MCP 2025-11-25 Specification Support** including SSE polling and event resumability (SEP-1699), multi-select enum elicitation schemas (SEP-1330), default values for elicitation (SEP-1034), and tool name validation at registration time (SEP-986).

</Update>

<Update label="v2.13.0" description="2025-10-25">
  **[v2.13.0: Cache Me If You Can](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.13.0)**

  FastMCP 2.13 "Cache Me If You Can" represents a fundamental maturation of the framework. After months of community feedback on authentication and state management, this release delivers the infrastructure FastMCP needs to handle production workloads: persistent storage, response caching, and pragmatic OAuth improvements that reflect real-world deployment challenges.

  💾 **Pluggable storage backends** bring persistent state to FastMCP servers. Built on [py-key-value-aio](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value), a new library from FastMCP maintainer Bill Easton ([@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate)), the storage layer provides encrypted disk storage by default, platform-aware token management, and a simple key-value interface for application state. We're excited to bring this elegantly designed library into the FastMCP ecosystem - it's both powerful and remarkably easy to use, including wrappers to add encryption, TTLs, caching, and more to backends ranging from Elasticsearch, Redis, DynamoDB, filesystem, in-memory, and more! OAuth providers now automatically persist tokens across restarts, and developers can store arbitrary state without reaching for external databases. This foundation enables long-running sessions, cached credentials, and stateful applications built on MCP.

  🔐 **OAuth maturity** brings months of production learnings into the framework. The new consent screen prevents confused deputy and authorization bypass attacks discovered in earlier versions while providing a clean UX with customizable branding. The OAuth proxy now issues its own tokens with automatic key derivation from client secrets, and RFC 7662 token introspection support enables enterprise auth flows. Path prefix mounting enables OAuth-protected servers to integrate into existing web applications under custom paths like `/api`, and MCP 1.17+ compliance with RFC 9728 ensures protocol compatibility. Combined with improved error handling and platform-aware token storage, OAuth is now production-ready and security-hardened for serious applications.

  FastMCP now supports out-of-the-box authentication with:

  * **[WorkOS](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/workos)** and **[AuthKit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/authkit)**
  * **[GitHub](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github)**
  * **[Google](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/google)**
  * **[Azure](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure)** (Entra ID)
  * **[AWS Cognito](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/aws-cognito)**
  * **[Auth0](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/auth0)**
  * **[Descope](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/descope)**
  * **[Scalekit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit)**
  * **[JWTs](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#jwt-token-verification)**
  * **[RFC 7662 token introspection](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#token-introspection-protocol)**

  ⚡ **Response Caching Middleware** dramatically improves performance for expensive operations. Cache tool and resource responses with configurable TTLs, reducing redundant API calls and speeding up repeated queries.

  🔄 **Server lifespans** provide proper initialization and cleanup hooks that run once per server instance instead of per client session. This fixes a long-standing source of confusion in the MCP SDK and enables proper resource management for database connections, background tasks, and other server-level state. Note: this is a breaking behavioral change if you were using the `lifespan` parameter.

  ✨ **Developer experience improvements** include Pydantic input validation for better type safety, icon support for richer UX, RFC 6570 query parameters for resource templates, improved Context API methods (list\_resources, list\_prompts, get\_prompt), and async file/directory resources.

  This release includes contributions from **20** new contributors and represents the largest feature set in a while. Thank you to everyone who tested preview builds and filed issues - your feedback shaped these improvements!

<Update label="v2.12.5" description="2025-10-17">
  **[v2.12.5: Safety Pin](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.12.5)**

  FastMCP 2.12.5 is a point release that pins the MCP SDK version below 1.17, which introduced a change affecting FastMCP users with auth providers mounted as part of a larger application. This ensures the `.well-known` payload appears in the expected location when using FastMCP authentication providers with composite applications.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.12.0" description="2025-08-31">
  **[v2.12.0: Auth to the Races](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.12.0)**

  FastMCP 2.12 represents one of our most significant releases to date, both in scope and community involvement. After extensive testing and iteration with the community, we're shipping major improvements to authentication, configuration, and MCP feature adoption.

  🔐 **OAuth Proxy for Broader Provider Support** addresses a fundamental challenge: while MCP requires Dynamic Client Registration (DCR), many popular OAuth providers don't support it. The new OAuth proxy bridges this gap, enabling FastMCP servers to authenticate with providers like GitHub, Google, WorkOS, and Azure through minimal configuration. These native integrations ship today, with more providers planned based on community needs.

  📋 **Declarative JSON Configuration** introduces a standardized, portable way to describe and deploy MCP servers. The `fastmcp.json` configuration file becomes the single source of truth for dependencies, transport settings, entrypoints, and server metadata. This foundation sets the stage for future capabilities like transformations and remote sources, moving toward a world where MCP servers are as portable and shareable as container images.

  🧠 **Sampling API Fallback** tackles the chicken-and-egg problem limiting adoption of advanced MCP features. Sampling—where servers request LLM completions from clients—is powerful but underutilized due to limited client support. FastMCP now lets server authors define fallback handlers that generate sampling completions server-side when clients don't support the feature, encouraging adoption while maintaining compatibility.

  This release took longer than usual to ship, and for good reason: the community's aggressive testing and feedback on the authentication system helped us reach a level of stability we're confident in. There's certainly more work ahead, but these foundations position FastMCP to handle increasingly complex use cases while remaining approachable for developers.

  Thank you to our new contributors and everyone who tested preview builds. Your feedback directly shaped these features.

</Update>

<Update label="v2.11.3" description="2025-08-11">
  **[v2.11.3: API-tite for Change](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.11.3)**

  This release includes significant enhancements to the experimental OpenAPI parser and fixes a significant bug that led schemas not to be included in input/output schemas if they were transitive dependencies (e.g. A → B → C implies A depends on C). For users naively transforming large OpenAPI specs into MCP servers, this may result in ballooning payload sizes and necessitate curation.

<Update label="v2.11.0" description="2025-08-01">
  ## [v2.11.0: Auth to a Good Start](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.11.0)

  FastMCP 2.11 doubles down on what developers need most: speed and simplicity. This massive release delivers significant performance improvements and a dramatically better developer experience.

  🔐 **Enterprise-Ready Authentication** brings comprehensive OAuth 2.1 support with WorkOS's AuthKit integration. The new AuthProvider interface leverages MCP's support for separate resource and authorization servers, handling API keys and remote authentication with Dynamic Client Registration. AuthKit integration means you can plug into existing enterprise identity systems without rebuilding your auth stack, setting the stage for plug-and-play auth that doesn't require users to become security experts overnight.

  ⚡ The **Experimental OpenAPI Parser** delivers dramatic performance improvements through single-pass schema processing and optimized memory usage. OpenAPI integrations are now significantly faster, with cleaner, more maintainable code. *(Note: the experimental parser is disabled by default, set `FASTMCPEXPERIMENTALENABLENEWOPENAPIPARSER=1` to enable it. A message will be shown to all users on the legacy parser encouraging them to try the new one before it becomes the default.)*

  🧠 **Context State Management** finally gives you persistent state across tool calls with a simple dict interface, while enhanced meta support lets you expose rich component metadata to clients. Combined with improved type annotations, string-based argument descriptions, and UV transport support, this release makes FastMCP feel more intuitive than ever.

  This release represents a TON of community contributions and sets the foundation for even more ambitious features ahead.

  ## [v2.10.0: Great Spec-tations](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.10.0)

  FastMCP 2.10 brings full compliance with the 6/18/2025 MCP spec update, introducing elicitation support for dynamic server-client communication and output schemas for structured tool responses. Please note that due to these changes, this release also includes a breaking change to the return signature of `client.call_tool()`.

  ### Elicitation Support

  Elicitation allows MCP servers to request additional information from clients during tool execution, enabling more interactive and dynamic server behavior. This opens up new possibilities for tools that need user input or confirmation during execution.

  ### Output Schemas

  Tools can now define structured output schemas, ensuring that responses conform to expected formats and making tool integration more predictable and type-safe.

  ## [v2.9.0: Stuck in the Middleware With You](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.9.0)

  FastMCP 2.9 introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol: MCP Middleware and server-side type conversion.

  ### MCP Middleware

  MCP middleware lets you intercept and modify requests and responses at the protocol level, giving you powerful capabilities for logging, authentication, validation, and more. This is particularly useful for building production-ready MCP servers that need sophisticated request handling.

  ### Server-side Type Conversion

  This release also introduces server-side type conversion for prompt arguments, ensuring that data is properly formatted before being passed to your functions. This reduces the burden on individual tools and prompts to handle type validation and conversion.

  ## What's Changed

  ### New Features 🎉

  * Add File utility for binary data by [@gorocode](https://github.com/gorocode) in [#843](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/843)

<Update label="v2.8.0" description="2024-06-10">
  ## [v2.8.0: Transform and Roll Out](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.8.0)

  FastMCP 2.8.0 introduces powerful new ways to customize and control your MCP servers!

  ### Tool Transformation

  The highlight of this release is first-class [**Tool Transformation**](/servers/transforms/tool-transformation), a new feature that lets you create enhanced variations of existing tools. You can now easily rename arguments, hide parameters, modify descriptions, and even wrap tools with custom validation or post-processing logic—all without rewriting the original code. This makes it easier than ever to adapt generic tools for specific LLM use cases or to simplify complex APIs. Huge thanks to [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) for partnering on this, starting with [#591](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/discussions/591) and [#599](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/599) and continuing offline.

  ### Component Control

  This release also gives you more granular control over which components are exposed to clients. With new [**tag-based filtering**](/servers/server#tag-based-filtering), you can selectively enable or disable tools, resources, and prompts based on tags, perfect for managing different environments or user permissions. Complementing this, every component now supports being [programmatically enabled or disabled](/servers/tools#disabling-tools), offering dynamic control over your server's capabilities.

  ### Tools-by-Default

  Finally, to improve compatibility with a wider range of LLM clients, this release changes the default behavior for OpenAPI integration: all API endpoints are now converted to `Tools` by default. This is a **breaking change** but pragmatically necessitated by the fact that the majority of MCP clients available today are, sadly, only compatible with MCP tools. Therefore, this change significantly simplifies the out-of-the-box experience and ensures your entire API is immediately accessible to any tool-using agent.

  ## What's Changed

</Update>

<Update label="v2.7.0" description="2024-06-05">
  ## [v2.7.0: Pare Programming](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v2.7.0)

  This is primarily a housekeeping release to remove or deprecate cruft that's accumulated since v1. Primarily, this release refactors FastMCP's internals in preparation for features planned in the next few major releases. However please note that as a result, this release has some minor breaking changes (which is why it's 2.7, not 2.6.2, in accordance with repo guidelines) though not to the core user-facing APIs.

  ### Breaking Changes 🛫

  * decorators return the objects they create, not the decorated function
  * websockets is an optional dependency
  * methods on the server for automatically converting functions into tools/resources/prompts have been deprecated in favor of using the decorators directly

  ### New Features 🎉

  * allow passing flags to servers by [@zzstoatzz](https://github.com/zzstoatzz) in [#690](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/690)
  * replace $ref pointing to `#/components/schemas/` with `#/$defs/\` by [@phateffect](https://github.com/phateffect) in [#697](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/697)

  * Formalize template/functiontemplate split by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#703](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/703)
  * Support flexible @tool decorator call patterns by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#706](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/706)
  * Ensure deprecation warnings have stacklevel=2 by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#710](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/710)
  * Allow naked prompt decorator by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#711](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/711)

  ### Fixes 🐞

  * Updates / Fixes for Tool Content Conversion by [@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate) in [#642](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/642)
  * Fix pr labeler permissions by [@jlowin](https://github.com/jlowin) in [#708](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/708)

  * Fix links in README.md by [@alainivars](https://github.com/alainivars) in [#723](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/pull/723)

  Happily, this release DOES permit the use of "naked" decorators to align with Pythonic practice:

  ```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  @mcp.tool
  def my_tool():
      ...
  ```

  ## [v1.0: It's Official](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/fastmcp/releases/tag/v1.0)

  This release commemorates FastMCP 1.0, which is included in the official Model Context Protocol SDK:

  ```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
  from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
  ```

  To the best of my knowledge, v1 is identical to the upstream version included with `mcp`.
