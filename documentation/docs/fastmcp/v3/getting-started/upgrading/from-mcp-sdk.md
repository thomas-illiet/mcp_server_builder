# Upgrading from the MCP SDK

> Upgrade from FastMCP in the MCP Python SDK to the standalone FastMCP framework

If your server starts with `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP`, you're using FastMCP 1.0 — the version bundled with v1 of the `mcp` package. Upgrading to the standalone FastMCP framework is easy. **For most servers, it's a single import change.**

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Before
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# After
from fastmcp import FastMCP
```

That's it. Your `@mcp.tool`, `@mcp.resource`, and `@mcp.prompt` decorators, your `mcp.run()` call, and the rest of your server code all work as-is.

<Tip>
  **Why upgrade?** FastMCP 1.0 pioneered the Pythonic MCP server experience, and we're proud it was bundled into the `mcp` package. The standalone FastMCP project has since grown into a full framework for taking MCP servers from prototype to production — with composition, middleware, proxy servers, authentication, and much more. Upgrading gives you access to all of that, plus ongoing updates and fixes.
</Tip>

## Install

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
pip install --upgrade fastmcp
# or
uv add fastmcp
```

FastMCP includes the `mcp` package as a dependency, so you don't lose access to anything. Update your import, run your server, and if your tools work, you're done.

  You are upgrading an MCP server from FastMCP 1.0 (bundled in the `mcp` package v1) to standalone FastMCP 3.0. Analyze the provided code and identify every change needed. The full upgrade guide is at [https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-mcp-sdk](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/upgrading/from-mcp-sdk) and the complete FastMCP documentation is at [https://gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com) — fetch these for complete context.

  STEP 1 — IMPORT (required for all servers):
  Change "from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP" to "from fastmcp import FastMCP".

  STEP 2 — CONSTRUCTOR KWARGS (only if FastMCP() receives transport settings):
  FastMCP() no longer accepts: host, port, log\_level, debug, sse\_path, streamable\_http\_path, json\_response, stateless\_http.
  Fix: pass these to run() instead.
  Before: `mcp = FastMCP("server", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080); mcp.run()`
  After:  `mcp = FastMCP("server"); mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)`

  STEP 3 — PROMPTS (only if using PromptMessage directly or returning dicts):
  mcp.types.PromptMessage is replaced by fastmcp.prompts.Message.
  Before: `PromptMessage(role="user", content=TextContent(type="text", text="Hello"))`
  After:  `Message("Hello")`  — role defaults to "user", accepts plain strings.
  Also: if prompts return raw dicts like `{"role": "user", "content": "..."}`, these must become Message objects or plain strings.
  The MCP SDK's FastMCP 1.0 silently coerced dicts; standalone FastMCP requires typed returns.

  STEP 4 — OTHER MCP IMPORTS (only if importing from mcp.\* directly):
  Direct imports from the `mcp` package (e.g., `import mcp.types`, `from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server`) still work because FastMCP includes `mcp` as a dependency. However, prefer FastMCP's own APIs where equivalents exist:

  * mcp.types.TextContent for tool returns → just return plain Python values (str, int, dict, etc.)
  * mcp.types.ImageContent → fastmcp.utilities.types.Image
  * from mcp.server.stdio import stdio\_server → not needed, mcp.run() handles transport

  STEP 5 — DECORATORS (only if treating decorated functions as objects):
  @mcp.tool, @mcp.resource, @mcp.prompt now return the original function, not a component object. Code that accesses .name or .description on the decorated result needs updating. Set FASTMCP\_DECORATOR\_MODE=object temporarily to restore v1 behavior (this compat setting is itself deprecated).

  For each issue found, show the original line, explain what changed, and provide the corrected code.
</Prompt>

## What Might Need Updating

Most servers need nothing beyond the import change. Skim the sections below to see if any apply.

### Constructor Settings

If you passed transport settings like `host` or `port` directly to `FastMCP()`, those now belong on `run()`. This keeps your server definition independent of how it's deployed:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Before
mcp = FastMCP("my-server", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
mcp.run()

# After
mcp = FastMCP("my-server")
mcp.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

If you pass the old kwargs, you'll get a clear `TypeError` with a migration hint.

### Prompts

If your prompt functions return `mcp.types.PromptMessage` objects or raw dicts with `role`/`content` keys, you'll need to upgrade to FastMCP's `Message` class. Or just return a plain string — it's automatically wrapped as a user message. The MCP SDK's bundled FastMCP 1.0 silently coerced dicts into messages; standalone FastMCP requires typed `Message` objects or strings.

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("prompts")

@mcp.prompt
def review(code: str) -> str:
    """Review code for issues"""
    return f"Please review this code:\n\n{code}"
```

For multi-turn prompts:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
from fastmcp.prompts import Message

@mcp.prompt
def debug(error: str) -> list[Message]:
    """Start a debugging session"""
    return [
        Message(f"I'm seeing this error:\n\n{error}"),
        Message("I'll help debug that. Can you share the relevant code?", role="assistant"),
    ]
```

### Other `mcp.*` Imports

If your server imports directly from the `mcp` package — like `import mcp.types` or `from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server` — those still work. FastMCP includes `mcp` as a dependency, so nothing breaks.

Where FastMCP provides its own API for the same thing, it's worth switching over:

| mcp Package                                       | FastMCP Equivalent                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `mcp.types.TextContent(type="text", text=str(x))` | Just return `x` from your tool              |
| `mcp.types.ImageContent(...)`                     | `from fastmcp.utilities.types import Image` |
| `mcp.types.PromptMessage(...)`                    | `from fastmcp.prompts import Message`       |
| `from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server`       | Not needed — `mcp.run()` handles transport  |

For anything without a FastMCP equivalent (e.g., specific protocol types you use directly), the `mcp.*` import is fine to keep.

### Decorated Functions

In FastMCP 1.0, `@mcp.tool` returned a `FunctionTool` object. Now decorators return your original function unchanged — so decorated functions stay callable for testing, reuse, and composition:

```python theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet someone"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# This works now — the function is still a regular function
assert greet("World") == "Hello, World!"
```

If you have code that accesses `.name`, `.description`, or other attributes on the decorated result, that will need updating. This is uncommon — most servers don't interact with the tool object directly. If you need the old behavior temporarily, set `FASTMCP_DECORATOR_MODE=object` to restore it (this compatibility setting is itself deprecated and will be removed in a future release).

## Verify the Upgrade

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
# Install
pip install --upgrade fastmcp

# Check version
fastmcp version

# Run your server
python my_server.py
```

You can also inspect your server's registered components with the FastMCP CLI:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp inspect my_server.py
```

## Looking Ahead

The MCP ecosystem is evolving fast. Part of FastMCP's job is to absorb that complexity on your behalf — as the protocol and its tooling grow, we do the work so your server code doesn't have to change.
