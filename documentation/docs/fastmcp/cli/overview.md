# CLI

> The fastmcp command-line interface

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <Badge stroke size="lg" icon="gift" iconType="regular" className="version-badge">
            New in version <code>{version}</code>
        </Badge>;
};

The `fastmcp` CLI is installed automatically with FastMCP. It's the primary way to run, test, install, and interact with MCP servers from your terminal.

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp --help
```

## Server Targets

Most commands need to know *which server* to talk to. You pass a "server spec" as the first argument, and FastMCP resolves the right transport automatically.

**URLs** connect to a running HTTP server:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list http://localhost:8000/mcp
fastmcp call http://localhost:8000/mcp get_forecast city=London
```

**Python files** are loaded directly — no `mcp.run()` boilerplate needed. FastMCP finds a server instance named `mcp`, `server`, or `app` in the file, or you can specify one explicitly:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list server.py
fastmcp run server.py:my_custom_server
```

**Config files** work too — both FastMCP's own `fastmcp.json` format and standard MCP config files with an `mcpServers` key:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp run fastmcp.json
fastmcp list mcp-config.json
```

**Stdio commands** connect to any MCP server that speaks over standard I/O. Use `--command` instead of a positional argument:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list --command 'npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github'
```

### Name-Based Resolution

If your servers are already configured in an editor or tool, you can refer to them by name. FastMCP scans configs from Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and Goose:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list weather
fastmcp call weather get_forecast city=London
```

When the same name appears in multiple configs, use the `source:name` form to be specific:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list claude-code:my-server
fastmcp call cursor:weather get_forecast city=London
```

Run [`fastmcp discover`](/cli/client#discovering-configured-servers) to see what's available on your machine.

## Authentication

### Prefect Horizon Account

Use the top-level account commands to manage the credential for Prefect Horizon.

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp login
fastmcp whoami
fastmcp logout
```

`fastmcp login` first uses `HORIZON_API_KEY` or a valid stored key when one is available.
When login needs a new key, it shows a verification URL and code.
It opens a browser when the terminal supports it.
If the browser does not open, use the shown URL and code on another device.
To switch accounts, run `fastmcp logout` before you run `fastmcp login` again.

Login stores only the personal Horizon API key.
It does not select or store a deployment organization.
`fastmcp whoami` gets the current user from Horizon.
`fastmcp logout` attempts to revoke the stored key and always removes its local credential.

Set `HORIZON_API_KEY` to use an environment credential instead.
The CLI gives that value first precedence and never stores it.
When this variable controls the session, logout does not revoke or remove any credential.
Remove the variable from your environment to sign out.

Use `--json` for stable command results.
During JSON login, the verification challenge goes to stderr and the final result goes to stdout.
JSON mode does not open a browser or ask a question.

### MCP Server Authentication

When targeting an HTTP URL, the CLI enables OAuth authentication by default. If the server requires it, you'll be guided through the flow (typically opening a browser). If it doesn't, the setup is a silent no-op.

To skip authentication entirely — useful for local development servers — pass `--auth none`:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp call http://localhost:8000/mcp my_tool --auth none
```

You can also pass a bearer token directly. Give the token value on its own; FastMCP adds the `Bearer` prefix when it builds the `Authorization` header.

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list http://localhost:8000/mcp --auth "sk-..."
```

## Transport Override

FastMCP defaults to Streamable HTTP for URL targets. If the server only supports Server-Sent Events (SSE), force the older transport:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list http://localhost:8000 --transport sse
```
