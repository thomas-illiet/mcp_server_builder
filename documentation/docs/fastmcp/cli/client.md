# Client Commands

> List tools, call them, and discover configured servers

export const VersionBadge = ({version}) => {
  return <Badge stroke size="lg" icon="gift" iconType="regular" className="version-badge">
            New in version <code>{version}</code>
        </Badge>;
};

<VersionBadge version="3.0.0" />

The CLI can act as an MCP client — connecting to any server (local or remote) to list what it exposes and call its tools directly. This is useful for development, debugging, scripting, and giving shell-capable LLM agents access to MCP servers.

## Listing Tools

`fastmcp list` connects to a server and prints its tools as function signatures, showing parameter names, types, and descriptions at a glance:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list http://localhost:8000/mcp
fastmcp list server.py
fastmcp list weather  # name-based resolution
```

When you need the full JSON Schema for a tool's inputs or outputs — for understanding nested objects, enum constraints, or complex types — opt in with `--input-schema` or `--output-schema`:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list server.py --input-schema
```

### Resources and Prompts

By default, only tools are shown. Add `--resources` or `--prompts` to include those:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list server.py --resources --prompts
```

### Machine-Readable Output

The `--json` flag switches to structured JSON with full schemas included. This is the format to use when feeding tool definitions to an LLM or building automation:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp list server.py --json
```

### Options

| Option        | Flag                | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Command       | `--command`         | Connect via stdio (e.g., `'npx -y @mcp/server'`)      |
| Transport     | `--transport`, `-t` | Force `http` or `sse` for URL targets                 |
| Resources     | `--resources`       | Include resources in output                           |
| Prompts       | `--prompts`         | Include prompts in output                             |
| Input Schema  | `--input-schema`    | Show full input schemas                               |
| Output Schema | `--output-schema`   | Show full output schemas                              |
| JSON          | `--json`            | Structured JSON output                                |
| Timeout       | `--timeout`         | Connection timeout in seconds                         |
| Auth          | `--auth`            | `oauth` (default for HTTP), a bearer token, or `none` |

## Calling Tools

`fastmcp call` invokes a single tool on a server. Pass arguments as `key=value` pairs — the CLI fetches the tool's schema and coerces your string values to the right types automatically:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp call server.py greet name=World
fastmcp call http://localhost:8000/mcp search query=hello limit=5
```

Type coercion is schema-driven: `"5"` becomes the integer `5` when the schema expects an integer. Booleans accept `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, and `1`/`0`. Arrays and objects are parsed as JSON.

### Complex Arguments

For tools with nested or structured parameters, `key=value` syntax gets awkward. Pass a single JSON object instead:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp call server.py create_item '{"name": "Widget", "tags": ["sale"], "metadata": {"color": "blue"}}'
```

Or use `--input-json` to provide a base dictionary, then override individual keys with `key=value` pairs:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp call server.py search --input-json '{"query": "hello", "limit": 5}' limit=10
```

### Error Handling

If you misspell a tool name, the CLI suggests corrections via fuzzy matching. Missing required arguments produce a clear message with the tool's signature as a reminder. Tool execution errors are printed with a non-zero exit code, making the CLI straightforward to use in scripts.

### Structured Output

`--json` emits the raw result including content blocks, error status, and structured content:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp call server.py get_weather city=London --json
```

### Interactive Elicitation

Some tools request additional input during execution through MCP's elicitation mechanism. When this happens, the CLI prompts you in the terminal — showing each field's name, type, and whether it's required. You can type `decline` to skip a question or `cancel` to abort the call entirely.

### Options

| Option     | Flag                | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Command    | `--command`         | Connect via stdio                                            |
| Transport  | `--transport`, `-t` | Force `http` or `sse`                                        |
| Prompt     | `--prompt`          | Treat the target as a prompt name instead of a tool/resource |
| Input JSON | `--input-json`      | Base arguments as JSON (merged with `key=value`)             |
| JSON       | `--json`            | Raw JSON output                                              |
| Timeout    | `--timeout`         | Connection timeout in seconds                                |
| Auth       | `--auth`            | `oauth`, a bearer token, or `none`                           |

## Reading Resources and Getting Prompts

`fastmcp call` can also read resources and render prompts. If the target contains `://`, the CLI treats it as a resource URI and calls `read_resource`:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp call server.py resource://docs/readme
fastmcp call server.py file:///tmp/example.txt --json
```

To get a prompt, pass `--prompt`; prompt arguments use the same `key=value` and `--input-json` forms as tool calls:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp call server.py summarize --prompt topic=weather
fastmcp call server.py summarize --prompt --input-json '{"topic": "weather"}'
```

## Discovering Configured Servers

`fastmcp discover` scans your machine for MCP servers configured in editors and tools. It checks:

* **Claude Desktop** — `claude_desktop_config.json`
* **Claude Code** — `~/.claude.json`
* **Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json` (walks up from current directory)
* **Gemini CLI** — `~/.gemini/settings.json`
* **Goose** — `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`
* **Project** — `./mcp.json` in the current directory

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp discover
```

The output groups servers by source, showing each server's name and transport. Filter by source or get machine-readable output:

```bash theme={"theme":{"light":"snazzy-light","dark":"dark-plus"}}
fastmcp discover --source claude-code
fastmcp discover --source cursor --source gemini --json
```

Any server that appears here can be used by name with `list`, `call`, and other commands — so you can go from "I have a server in Claude Code" to querying it without copying URLs or paths.

## LLM Agent Integration

For LLM agents that can execute shell commands but don't have native MCP support, the CLI provides a clean bridge. The agent calls `fastmcp list --json` to discover available tools with full schemas, then `fastmcp call --json` to invoke them with structured results.

Because the CLI handles connection management, transport selection, and type coercion internally, the agent doesn't need to understand MCP protocol details — it just reads JSON and constructs shell commands.

## Remote Stdio Bridges

For MCP hosts that expect a local stdio command but need to connect to a remote HTTP server, use [`fastmcp-remote`](/clients/fastmcp-remote). It provides a small standalone bridge for host configuration, while `fastmcp list` and `fastmcp call` remain focused on direct inspection and invocation from the terminal.
